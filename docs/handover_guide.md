# Handover Documentation Guide

## Purpose
This guide outlines the process and format for creating handover documents between Cline sessions. These documents ensure continuity and transparency throughout the development process of GameBook Studio.

## Handover Document Location
All handover documents are stored in the `/handover_docs` directory using the naming format: `DD-MM-YYYY-HH24MI_handover.md`

## Template Structure

### Date and Time of Handover
Include the exact date and time of completing the handover.

### Project Overview
This is a Gamebook Studio application built with React, TypeScript and Vite. It's a comprehensive tool for creating interactive gamebooks/choose-your-own-adventure stories with features like:

Interactive paragraph editor with rich text formatting
Visual story mapping and node connections
Multi-language support (English/Italian)
Dark/light theme
Image handling and editing
Export capabilities to multiple formats
Auto-saving and backup functionality
Project library management
The development server is already running, allowing real-time preview of changes. The project uses modern web technologies and follows a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns.

The core functionality revolves around creating and managing interactive narratives where each paragraph can connect to multiple others, creating branching storylines. The UI is polished and professional, with careful attention to user experience.
