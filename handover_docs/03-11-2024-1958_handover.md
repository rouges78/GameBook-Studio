## Project Overview
This is a Gamebook Studio application built with React, TypeScript and Vite. It's a comprehensive tool for creating interactive gamebooks/choose-your-own-adventure stories with features like:

- Interactive paragraph editor with rich text formatting
- Visual story mapping and node connections
- Multi-language support (English/Italian)
- Dark/light theme
- Image handling and editing
- Export capabilities to multiple formats
- Auto-saving and backup functionality
- Project library management

The development server is already running, allowing real-time preview of changes. The project uses modern web technologies and follows a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns.

The core functionality revolves around creating and managing interactive narratives where each paragraph can connect to multiple others, creating branching storylines. The UI is polished and professional, with careful attention to user experience.

## Current Progress
- Implemented auto-update functionality in electron/main.js
- Added electron-updater configuration with proper logging
- Enhanced error handling for file operations
- Improved development vs production environment handling
- Added hourly update checks with proper event handling
- Connected update events to renderer process via IPC

## Issues and Resolutions
Issues:
- Main process lacked auto-update functionality despite having electron-updater installed
- File operations needed better error handling

Resolutions:
- Implemented comprehensive auto-update system with proper error handling and logging
- Enhanced file operation handlers with try-catch blocks and proper error reporting
- Added development/production environment detection for update checks

## Documentation Updates
Modified files:
- electron/main.js: Added auto-update implementation and improved file operations
- handover_docs/03-11-2024-1958_handover.md: Created new handover document

## Next Steps
1. Test auto-update functionality:
   - Build production version
   - Verify update detection
   - Test update download and installation

2. Implement update UI:
   - Add update notification component
   - Create progress indicator for downloads
   - Add update settings to preferences

3. Enhance file operations:
   - Add support for more file types
   - Implement file type validation
   - Add file operation error notifications

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Auto-update system is implemented but needs testing in production environment
- Update notification UI needs to be implemented in React components
- Consider adding update preferences to Settings component
- File operations have been improved but may need additional file type support
- The electron-updater logger is configured to store logs at info level
- Update checks are scheduled hourly in production mode only
