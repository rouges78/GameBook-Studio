## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is a desktop application for creating interactive gamebooks and branching narratives. The application is built with React, TypeScript, and Electron, featuring a comprehensive set of tools for story creation and management.

## Current Progress
- Implemented auto-update system with UI components:
  - Created UpdateNotification component for displaying update status
  - Added useAutoUpdater hook for managing update state
  - Enhanced electron main process with update handlers
  - Added proper type definitions across the system
- Fixed type compatibility issues:
  - Made Header component version fields optional
  - Added paragraph transformation for ExportPage compatibility
  - Updated type definitions for better type safety

## Issues and Resolutions
Issues:
- Type mismatch between ParagraphEditor and ExportPage paragraph types
- Null vs undefined type conflicts in update notification system
- Missing package.json fields for version information

Resolutions:
- Created transformation function for paragraphs between editor and export formats
- Updated useAutoUpdater to use undefined instead of null
- Made version-related fields optional in Header component

## Documentation Updates
Modified files:
- src/components/UpdateNotification/types.ts: Added update notification type definitions
- src/components/UpdateNotification/index.tsx: Created update notification UI component
- src/hooks/useAutoUpdater.ts: Added hook for managing update state
- electron/types.d.ts: Added shared type definitions
- electron/preload.ts: Enhanced IPC communication for updates
- electron/main.js: Added update handlers and improved error handling
- src/App.tsx: Integrated update notification system
- src/components/Header.tsx: Made version fields optional

## Next Steps
1. Test update system:
   - Build production version
   - Test update detection
   - Verify download progress display
   - Test update installation

2. Add update settings:
   - Create update frequency configuration
   - Add auto-download option
   - Implement update deferral

3. Enhance error handling:
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed downloads
   - Improve error messages
   - Add offline detection

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- The update system is fully implemented but needs testing in a production environment
- Update UI is integrated into the main application
- The system supports manual and automatic update checks
- Error handling is in place but could be enhanced
- Consider adding update preferences to Settings component
