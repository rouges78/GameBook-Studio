## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is a desktop application for creating interactive gamebooks and branching narratives. The application is built with React, TypeScript, and Electron, featuring a comprehensive set of tools for story creation and management.

## Current Progress
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues:
  - Updated tsconfig.build.json to properly handle Electron builds
  - Resolved module resolution conflicts
  - Fixed output directory configuration
- Prepared auto-update system for testing:
  - Built initial version 0.1.0
  - Created update version 0.1.1
  - Generated proper latest.yml files for update detection
  - Moved electron package to devDependencies as required

## Issues and Resolutions
Issues:
- TypeScript configuration conflicts between Electron and Vite builds
- Electron package incorrectly placed in dependencies
- Build configuration needed adjustments for proper update system setup

Resolutions:
- Updated tsconfig.build.json with correct module and resolution settings
- Moved electron to devDependencies
- Successfully built both versions with proper update configuration

## Documentation Updates
Modified files:
- package.json: Updated version and fixed dependencies
- tsconfig.build.json: Fixed build configuration
- Generated new installers and update files in release directory

## Next Steps
1. Test update system:
   - Install version 0.1.0
   - Run the application and verify initial version
   - Test update detection for version 0.1.1
   - Verify update download and installation process

2. Verify update notification UI:
   - Check if update notification appears
   - Test download progress display
   - Verify installation prompt
   - Confirm successful update to 0.1.1

3. Document update system behavior:
   - Record update detection time
   - Note any user prompts or notifications
   - Document the update process flow

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Both versions (0.1.0 and 0.1.1) are built and ready for testing
- Update system configuration is in place
- Next step is to test the actual update process
- Consider setting up a proper update server for production use
