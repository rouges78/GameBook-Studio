## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is a desktop application for creating interactive gamebooks and branching narratives. Currently testing the auto-update system to ensure smooth updates from version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1.

## Current Progress
- Fixed and improved auto-update configuration:
  - Added proper publish configuration in package.json
  - Added specific Windows build settings
  - Configured local update server path
  - Successfully built both version 0.1.0 and 0.1.1
  - Generated proper latest.yml for update detection

## Issues and Resolutions
Initial Issues:
- Installer for version 0.1.0 was closing immediately after launch
- Missing proper publish configuration in package.json

Resolutions:
- Updated package.json with proper electron-builder configuration
- Added specific Windows build settings
- Configured local update server path
- Rebuilt both versions with correct settings

## Documentation Updates
- Updated package.json with proper build and publish configuration
- Created new handover document to track update system testing progress

## Next Steps
1. Test version 0.1.0 installer:
   - Launch installer and verify it completes successfully
   - Verify application launches correctly
   - Check initial version number

2. Test auto-update detection:
   - Verify update notification appears
   - Test download functionality
   - Monitor progress bar behavior
   - Verify installation process

3. Document update process:
   - Record any issues encountered
   - Note update detection time
   - Document user experience
   - Verify successful update to 0.1.1

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Both versions (0.1.0 and 0.1.1) have been rebuilt with proper configuration
- Update system is configured to use local update server
- The update process should be automatic with user confirmation for installation
- Testing should focus on the complete update flow from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
