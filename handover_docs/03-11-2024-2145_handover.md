## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application stores its data in the user's AppData directory (C:\Users\rouges\AppData\Roaming\gamebook-studio) and uses SQLite for the database.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented a new backup system that stores backups in the AppData directory
   - Created BackupManager class in electron/backup.ts
   - Added IPC handlers for backup operations in main process
   - Updated preload script with new backup methods
   - Created TypeScript types for backup operations
   - Updated frontend autoBackup utility to use new IPC-based system

### Implementation Details
- Database location: `C:\Users\rouges\AppData\Roaming\gamebook-studio\dev.db`
- Backup location: `C:\Users\rouges\AppData\Roaming\gamebook-studio\backups`
- Backup features:
  - Automatic backups at configurable intervals
  - Manual backup creation
  - Backup restoration
  - Backup import/export
  - Backup listing with metadata
  - Integrity checking with checksums

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows Electron best practices by:
- Using IPC for communication between renderer and main processes
- Properly handling file system operations in the main process
- Maintaining type safety with TypeScript
- Including error handling and logging

## Documentation Updates
- Created new types in electron/types.d.ts and src/types/electron.d.ts
- Updated existing backup-related code to use new system
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

## Next Steps
1. Add backup management UI
   - Create a new component to list available backups
   - Add UI controls for backup operations (create, restore, import, export)
   - Display backup metadata (timestamp, size, etc.)

2. Implement backup cleanup
   - Add settings for backup retention period
   - Create cleanup job to remove old backups
   - Add UI for managing backup retention settings

3. Testing
   - Test backup system in various scenarios
   - Verify backup integrity checking
   - Test automatic backup scheduling
   - Test backup restoration process

## Notes for Next Session
- The backup system is ready for use but needs a user interface
- Consider adding progress indicators for backup operations
- May want to add compression for backups to save space
- Consider adding backup encryption for sensitive data
- Need to test backup system with large projects
