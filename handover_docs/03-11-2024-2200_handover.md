## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application stores its data in the user's AppData directory (C:\Users\rouges\AppData\Roaming\gamebook-studio) and uses SQLite for the database.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created BackupManager component with the following features:
   - List available backups with metadata (timestamp, size, version)
   - Create new backups
   - Restore backups
   - Import/Export backups
   - User-friendly interface with loading states and error handling
   - Translations support (IT/EN)

2. Integrated BackupManager into the application:
   - Added BackupManager route in App.tsx
   - Updated Dashboard component to support the new route
   - Added BackupManager button to Sidebar with icon and translations
   - Implemented proper type definitions for backup operations

### Implementation Details
- Created new components:
  - src/components/BackupManager/index.tsx (main component)
  - src/components/BackupManager/types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
  - src/components/BackupManager/translations.ts (i18n support)
- Uses existing IPC methods from electron/backup.ts:
  - backup:create
  - backup:restore
  - backup:list
  - backup:export
  - backup:import

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows the project's patterns:
- Consistent use of TypeScript
- Proper error handling
- Translation support
- Responsive UI design
- Integration with existing backup system

## Documentation Updates
- Added types for backup operations
- Updated electron.d.ts with backup-related IPC methods
- Added translations for backup management features

## Next Steps
1. Implement backup cleanup functionality:
   - Add settings for backup retention period
   - Create cleanup job to remove old backups
   - Add UI for managing backup retention settings

2. Add backup compression:
   - Implement compression for backup files
   - Update import/export to handle compressed files
   - Add progress indicators for compression/decompression

3. Add backup encryption:
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data
   - Add password protection option for backups
   - Update UI to handle encrypted backups

4. Testing:
   - Test backup system with large projects
   - Verify backup integrity checking
   - Test automatic backup scheduling
   - Test backup restoration process
   - Test import/export functionality

## Notes for Next Session
- The backup UI is implemented but needs testing with real data
- Consider adding a confirmation dialog before restoring backups
- May want to add search/filter capabilities for the backup list
- Consider adding backup categories or tags
- Need to implement proper error messages for all failure scenarios
