## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a backup system with configurable retention settings and automatic cleanup functionality.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented backup cleanup functionality:
   - Added configurable retention settings (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Implemented automatic cleanup based on retention settings
   - Added backup categories (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Created settings UI for managing retention periods

2. Enhanced BackupManager component:
   - Added settings panel for backup configuration
   - Added backup statistics display
   - Added manual cleanup button
   - Updated UI to show backup categories
   - Added retention period management

3. Updated type definitions and interfaces:
   - Added BackupSettings interface
   - Updated BackupMetadata to include retention categories
   - Added new IPC methods for settings management

4. Added new IPC handlers:
   - backup:getSettings
   - backup:updateSettings
   - backup:runCleanup

### Implementation Details
- Created new interfaces in types.d.ts for backup settings
- Enhanced BackupManager class with retention logic
- Added settings persistence in user data directory
- Implemented automatic cleanup during backup creation
- Added manual cleanup functionality
- Updated translations for new features

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows the project's patterns:
- TypeScript type safety
- Proper error handling
- Translation support
- Responsive UI design

## Documentation Updates
- Updated type definitions for backup operations
- Added interfaces for backup settings
- Added translations for backup management features

## Next Steps
1. Testing:
   - Test backup retention logic with various settings
   - Verify automatic cleanup functionality
   - Test manual cleanup operation
   - Verify backup categorization
   - Test settings persistence

2. Compression Implementation:
   - Add compression for backup files
   - Update import/export to handle compressed files
   - Add progress indicators for compression/decompression

3. Encryption Implementation:
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data
   - Add password protection option
   - Update UI to handle encrypted backups

4. UI Improvements:
   - Add confirmation dialogs for critical operations
   - Add search/filter capabilities for backup list
   - Add sorting options for backup table
   - Add backup preview functionality

## Notes for Next Session
- The backup settings UI is implemented but needs thorough testing
- Consider adding backup file size optimization
- May want to add backup scheduling capabilities
- Consider adding backup verification tools
- Need to implement proper error handling for all edge cases
