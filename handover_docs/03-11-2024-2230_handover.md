## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a backup system with configurable retention settings, automatic cleanup functionality, and now supports compression for backup files.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented backup compression:
   - Added compression option to backup settings
   - Implemented gzip compression for backup files
   - Added separate metadata files for compressed backups
   - Updated backup file format to handle both compressed and uncompressed data
   - Added compression-related fields to backup metadata

2. Enhanced BackupManager implementation:
   - Added compression/decompression methods
   - Updated file handling for compressed backups
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing backups
   - Added proper error handling for compression operations

3. Added comprehensive tests:
   - Test cases for compressed backup creation and restoration
   - Tests for mixed compressed/uncompressed backups
   - Compression settings change tests
   - Export/import tests with compression
   - Backup integrity tests with compression

### Implementation Details
- Compression is configurable through backup settings
- Compressed backups use .gz extension with separate .meta.json files
- Uncompressed backups maintain the original format
- Added type safety improvements for compression-related features
- Implemented proper error handling for compression/decompression operations

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows the project's patterns:
- TypeScript type safety maintained
- Proper error handling for all operations
- Backward compatibility preserved
- Efficient file handling

## Documentation Updates
- Updated type definitions for compression support
- Added compression-related fields to BackupMetadata interface
- Updated BackupSettings interface with compression option
- Added comprehensive test cases for compression features

## Next Steps
1. UI Implementation:
   - Add compression toggle to backup settings UI
   - Add compression status indicator in backup list
   - Show compression ratio in backup details
   - Add progress indicators for compression/decompression

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Consider implementing worker threads for compression
   - Add compression level options
   - Optimize memory usage during compression
   - Add batch compression capability

3. Error Handling Improvements:
   - Add specific error types for compression failures
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed compressions
   - Add detailed error reporting in UI
   - Implement compression verification

4. Additional Features:
   - Add backup file encryption
   - Implement backup verification tools
   - Add backup scheduling capabilities
   - Consider adding backup file splitting for large projects

## Notes for Next Session
- The compression implementation is complete and tested
- UI components need to be updated to support compression features
- Consider adding compression statistics to backup reports
- May want to add compression level configuration
- Need to implement proper error handling in UI for compression-related errors
