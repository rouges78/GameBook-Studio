## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature for visualizing and managing the story structure. Recent improvements have focused on enhancing the map navigation and user experience.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Enhanced StoryMap Navigation:
   - Implemented mouse-position-based zooming for more intuitive zoom behavior
   - Extended zoom range (0.25x to 4x) for better detail control
   - Added smooth inertia scrolling for more natural panning
   - Created MiniMap component for easier navigation of large maps

2. Technical Improvements:
   - Added TypeScript type safety throughout StoryMap components
   - Improved state management in useStoryMap hook
   - Implemented bounds checking for all map movements
   - Added proper cleanup for inertia animations

### Implementation Details
- Zoom now centers on mouse position when using scroll wheel
- Inertia scrolling uses physics-based deceleration
- MiniMap shows live viewport position and allows direct navigation
- All map movements are constrained within bounds
- Improved type definitions for better code maintainability

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows the project's patterns:
- TypeScript type safety maintained
- React hooks best practices followed
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and animations
- Smooth performance with large maps

## Documentation Updates
- Added type definitions for new components and hooks
- Updated component interfaces for improved type safety
- Added documentation for new navigation features

## Next Steps
1. UI Improvements:
   - Add zoom level indicator
   - Implement zoom to fit functionality
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Consider adding touch/gesture support

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement node clustering for large maps
   - Add viewport culling for better performance
   - Consider WebGL rendering for very large maps
   - Optimize pan/zoom calculations

3. Additional Features:
   - Add map overview mode
   - Implement node search functionality
   - Add custom grid settings
   - Consider adding map annotations

## Notes for Next Session
- The navigation improvements are complete and tested
- Consider adding automated tests for new features
- May want to add configuration options for inertia scrolling
- Consider implementing undo/redo for map navigation
- Need to update user documentation with new features
