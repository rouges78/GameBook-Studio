## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature for visualizing and managing the story structure. Recent improvements have focused on enhancing user feedback through visual notifications and keyboard shortcuts.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Toast Notification System:
   - Created reusable Toast component with animations
   - Implemented ToastManager for handling multiple notifications
   - Added useToast hook for easy integration
   - Integrated with keyboard shortcuts for visual feedback

2. Visual Feedback Added for:
   - Zoom operations (in/out/reset)
   - Grid toggle
   - Drag mode toggle
   - Map saving
   - Other keyboard shortcut actions

3. Technical Improvements:
   - Added React Portal for Toast rendering
   - Implemented smooth animations
   - Added proper cleanup for timers
   - Ensured accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### Implementation Details
- Toast notifications appear at the bottom of the screen
- Smooth fade in/out animations
- Automatic cleanup after display
- Support for multiple concurrent notifications
- Clean integration with existing keyboard shortcuts

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows the project's patterns:
- TypeScript type safety maintained
- React hooks best practices followed
- Proper cleanup of timers and event listeners
- Accessible implementation

## Documentation Updates
- Added Toast component documentation
- Updated keyboard shortcuts documentation
- Added useToast hook documentation
- Updated user interface documentation

## Next Steps
1. UI Improvements:
   - Add different toast types (success, error, warning)
   - Implement toast queuing for better control
   - Add toast position customization
   - Consider adding toast actions (undo, etc.)

2. Additional Features:
   - Add sound effects for notifications
   - Implement notification grouping
   - Add notification preferences
   - Consider adding notification history

3. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Add screen reader announcements
   - Implement keyboard navigation for toasts
