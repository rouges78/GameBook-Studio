## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature for visualizing and managing the story structure. Recent improvements have focused on enhancing the notification system with different types and improved visual feedback.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Enhanced Toast Notification System:
   - Added support for different notification types (success, error, warning, info)
   - Implemented distinct visual styles for each type
   - Added appropriate icons for each notification type
   - Improved accessibility with ARIA attributes

2. Visual Enhancements:
   - Added color-coded notifications:
     * Success: Green with checkmark icon
     * Error: Red with X icon
     * Warning: Yellow with exclamation icon
     * Info: Gray with information icon
   - Added border accents for better visibility
   - Implemented smooth animations
   - Added icon support for better visual context

3. Notification Integration:
   - Zoom operations now show appropriate warnings at limits
   - Save operations show success/error feedback
   - Grid and drag mode toggles show info notifications
   - Background image upload shows success/error status
   - Node locking shows status updates

### Implementation Details
- Toast notifications are context-aware:
  * Success notifications for completed actions
  * Error notifications for failed operations
  * Warning notifications for limits or potential issues
  * Info notifications for status updates
- Improved error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added async/await support for operations
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA roles

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation follows the project's patterns:
- TypeScript type safety maintained
- React hooks best practices followed
- Proper error handling implemented
- Accessible implementation with ARIA support

## Documentation Updates
- Updated Toast component documentation
- Added notification type definitions
- Updated error handling documentation
- Added accessibility documentation

## Next Steps
1. UI Improvements:
   - Add notification stacking
   - Implement notification priority system
   - Add notification interaction (dismiss, action)
   - Consider adding notification sounds

2. Additional Features:
   - Add notification persistence options
   - Implement notification grouping
   - Add notification preferences
   - Consider adding notification history

3. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Add keyboard navigation for notifications
   - Implement screen reader announcements
   - Add high contrast mode support
   - Consider adding notification timing preferences

## Notes for Next Session
- The enhanced notification system is complete and tested
- Consider adding automated tests for different notification types
- May want to add user preferences for notification duration
- Consider implementing notification queuing
- Need to update user documentation with new notification types
- Consider adding sound effects for important notifications
