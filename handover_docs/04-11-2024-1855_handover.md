## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature with an enhanced notification system. Recent work has focused on implementing notification stacking functionality to improve the user experience when multiple notifications are displayed.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Notification Stacking:
   - Added vertical stacking of notifications
   - Implemented proper spacing between notifications (16px)
   - Added z-index management for proper layering
   - Limited maximum visible notifications to 3 at a time
   - Added smooth animations for stack management

2. Enhanced Toast Component:
   - Added index-based positioning
   - Implemented dynamic bottom positioning
   - Added z-index calculations based on notification order
   - Maintained existing notification types and styling
   - Preserved accessibility features

### Implementation Details
- Toast notifications now stack vertically with proper spacing
- Most recent notifications appear at the bottom
- Maximum of 3 notifications visible at once
- Older notifications are automatically removed when limit is reached
- Smooth animations when adding/removing notifications
- Proper z-indexing ensures newer notifications appear on top
- Maintained existing color coding and icons for different types

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation maintains:
- TypeScript type safety
- React best practices
- Proper accessibility support
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Documentation Updates
- Updated Toast component documentation with stacking behavior
- Added maxVisible prop documentation
- Updated positioning and animation documentation

## Next Steps
1. Notification Interaction:
   - Add click-to-dismiss functionality
   - Implement manual close button
   - Add hover pause for animations
   - Consider swipe-to-dismiss on touch devices

2. Notification Priority:
   - Implement priority levels for messages
   - Add duration control based on priority
   - Consider persistent notifications for critical messages
   - Add priority-based positioning

3. Sound Effects:
   - Add subtle sound effects for notifications
   - Implement different sounds per notification type
   - Add user preference for sound control
   - Consider accessibility implications

## Notes for Next Session
- The stacking system is complete and working
- Consider adding automated tests for stacking behavior
- May want to add animation speed preferences
- Consider implementing notification groups
- Need to update user documentation with stacking behavior
- Consider adding keyboard navigation for notification stack
