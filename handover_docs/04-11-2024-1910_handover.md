## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature with an enhanced notification system. Recent work has focused on implementing notification interaction features to improve user control and accessibility.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Notification Interaction Features:
   - Added click-to-dismiss functionality
   - Implemented dedicated close button
   - Added hover pause functionality
   - Enhanced visual feedback
   - Improved accessibility

2. Enhanced Toast Component:
   - Added pause/resume timer functionality
   - Implemented remaining time tracking
   - Added smooth exit animations
   - Enhanced cursor interactions
   - Added hover brightness effect

### Implementation Details
- Click anywhere on toast to dismiss
- Dedicated close button in top-right corner
- Hover pauses auto-dismiss timer
- Smooth exit animations (300ms)
- Proper event propagation handling
- Enhanced accessibility with ARIA labels
- Visual feedback with hover effects

## Technical Improvements

## Issues and Resolutions
No major issues encountered. The implementation maintains:
- TypeScript type safety
- React best practices
- Clean event handling
- Proper timer management

## Documentation Updates
- Updated Toast component documentation
- Added interaction behavior documentation
- Updated accessibility documentation
- Added timer management details

## Next Steps
1. Notification Priority System:
   - Implement priority levels
   - Add duration control based on priority
   - Consider persistent notifications
   - Add priority-based positioning

2. Sound Effects:
   - Add subtle notification sounds
