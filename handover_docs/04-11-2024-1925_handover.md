## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature with an enhanced notification system. Recent work has focused on implementing automated tests for the Toast notification component to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Comprehensive Test Suite:
   - Added unit tests for Toast component
   - Added integration tests for ToastManager
   - Added tests for useToast hook
   - Configured Jest environment for React testing
   - Added test coverage for all major features

2. Test Coverage Areas:
   - Basic rendering and props
   - Different notification types
   - Timer functionality
   - Hover pause feature
   - Click-to-dismiss
   - Close button functionality
   - Toast stacking
   - Position calculations
   - Hook functionality

3. Test Infrastructure:
   - Added Jest DOM environment
   - Configured Babel for JSX
   - Added type definitions
   - Mocked React Portal
   - Set up timer mocks

### Implementation Details
- Test Categories:
  * Component rendering tests
  * Style and appearance tests
  * Interaction tests
  * Timer and animation tests
  * Integration tests
  * Hook behavior tests

- Test Infrastructure:
  * Jest configuration
  * Babel setup
  * TypeScript support
  * React Testing Library
  * Custom matchers

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Fixed Jest Configuration:
   - Added jest-environment-jsdom
   - Configured Babel presets
   - Added CSS module mocking
   - Fixed type definitions

2. Fixed Test Issues:
   - Resolved portal rendering
   - Fixed style assertions
   - Improved timer mocking
   - Enhanced type safety

## Documentation Updates
- Added test documentation
- Updated Jest configuration
- Added type definitions
- Updated Babel configuration

## Next Steps
1. Priority System Implementation:
   - Add priority levels to notifications
   - Implement duration control
   - Add persistent notifications
   - Test priority features

2. Sound Effects:
   - Add notification sounds
   - Implement sound preferences
   - Add accessibility options
   - Test sound features

3. Additional Testing:
   - Add snapshot tests
   - Increase test coverage
   - Add performance tests
   - Add accessibility tests

## Notes for Next Session
- All tests are passing
- Test infrastructure is complete
- Ready for priority system implementation
- Consider adding E2E tests
- May want to add visual regression tests
- Consider adding performance benchmarks
