## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. The application includes a StoryMap feature with an enhanced notification system. Recent work has focused on implementing a priority system for notifications and comprehensive testing.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Priority System:
   - Added priority levels (low, normal, high, critical)
   - Implemented priority-based duration control
   - Added priority-based z-indexing
   - Implemented priority-based sorting
   - Added persistent notification support

2. Enhanced Toast Component:
   - Added priority configuration
   - Implemented priority-based behaviors
   - Added critical notification handling
   - Enhanced accessibility for different priorities
   - Added persistent notification support

3. Implemented Comprehensive Tests:
   - Added priority system tests
   - Added sorting tests
   - Added persistence tests
   - Added interaction tests
   - Added accessibility tests

### Implementation Details
1. Priority System:
   - Low: 2s duration, base z-index
   - Normal: 3s duration, +10 z-index
   - High: 5s duration, +20 z-index
   - Critical: Persistent, +30 z-index

2. Sorting Logic:
   - Primary sort by priority
   - Secondary sort by ID (most recent first)
   - Limited to maxVisible notifications
   - Maintains priority order during updates

3. Interaction Behavior:
   - Critical notifications cannot be dismissed
   - Persistent notifications ignore duration
   - Priority affects hover behavior
   - Enhanced accessibility for critical messages

## Technical Improvements
1. Code Organization:
   - Added priorityConfig object
   - Enhanced type definitions
   - Improved component props
   - Better state management

2. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added priority-specific tests
   - Enhanced test coverage
   - Added interaction tests
   - Improved test reliability

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Fixed Priority Sorting:
   - Added order property to priorityConfig
   - Improved sorting algorithm
   - Fixed slice operation
   - Added ID-based secondary sort

2. Fixed Test Issues:
   - Updated test assertions
   - Fixed timing issues
   - Improved test reliability
   - Enhanced error messages

## Documentation Updates
- Added priority system documentation
- Updated component documentation
- Added test documentation
- Updated type definitions

## Next Steps
1. Sound Effects:
   - Add notification sounds
   - Implement priority-based sounds
   - Add sound preferences
   - Consider accessibility

2. Animation Improvements:
   - Add priority-based animations
   - Enhance stacking animations
   - Add transition effects
   - Improve performance

3. Mobile Support:
   - Add touch interactions
   - Implement swipe gestures
   - Add responsive layout
   - Test on mobile devices

## Notes for Next Session
- All priority features are working
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Ready for sound implementation
- Consider adding visual feedback
- May want to add animation options
- Consider adding mobile-specific features
