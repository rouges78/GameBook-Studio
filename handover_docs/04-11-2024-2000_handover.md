## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an Electron-based application for creating interactive gamebooks. Recent work has focused on implementing a notification sound system with priority-based behavior and comprehensive testing.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Sound Manager:
   - Created singleton sound manager class
   - Added support for different notification types
   - Implemented priority-based behavior
   - Added volume control and enable/disable functionality
   - Added persistence for sound settings
   - Added preloading for better performance

2. Implemented Sound Integration with Toast:
   - Added sound support to notifications
   - Different sounds for different notification types
   - Priority-based sound behavior
   - Critical notifications have distinct sounds

3. Implemented Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added sound manager unit tests
   - Added toast sound integration tests
   - Created mock Audio implementation
   - Added test helpers for sound testing
   - Improved test reliability

### Implementation Details
1. Sound Manager Features:
   - Different sounds for success, error, warning, info, critical
   - Volume control with clamping
   - Enable/disable functionality
   - Settings persistence in localStorage
   - Sound preloading for performance

2. Toast Integration:
   - Automatic sound playing on notification
   - Priority-based sound behavior
   - Critical notifications use distinct sound
   - Sound respects enabled/disabled state

3. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Mock Audio implementation
   - Jest module isolation
   - Test helpers for sound testing
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Technical Improvements
1. Code Organization:
   - Singleton pattern for sound manager
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type-safe interfaces
   - Consistent error handling

2. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Modular test structure
   - Reliable mocking system
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Improved test reliability

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Fixed Testing Issues:
   - Resolved module isolation issues
   - Fixed mock Audio implementation
   - Improved test reliability
   - Added proper cleanup

2. Fixed Sound Manager Issues:
   - Improved volume control
   - Fixed preloading behavior
   - Improved error handling
   - Fixed persistence issues

## Documentation Updates
- Added sound manager documentation
- Updated test documentation
- Added implementation details
- Updated type definitions

## Next Steps
1. Sound Customization:
   - Add custom sound support
   - Add sound theme support
   - Add sound pack support
   - Add sound preview

2. Performance Improvements:
   - Optimize sound loading
   - Add sound caching
   - Improve preloading
   - Add lazy loading

3. Accessibility:
   - Add screen reader support
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Add sound descriptions
   - Add sound alternatives

## Notes for Next Session
- All sound features are working
- Tests are comprehensive and passing
- Ready for sound customization
- Consider adding sound themes
- May want to add sound packs
- Consider adding sound preview feature
