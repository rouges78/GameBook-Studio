## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently working on improving the auto-update functionality with error handling and resilience.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Added error boundary for update notifications:
   - Created UpdateErrorBoundary component with error UI
   - Wrapped UpdateNotification in App.tsx with error boundary
   - Added comprehensive tests for error boundary

### Implementation Details
- Error boundary catches and displays update-related errors
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Maintains dark mode compatibility
- Includes proper cleanup and error logging

### Code Changes
- New files:
  - src/components/UpdateNotification/ErrorBoundary.tsx
  - tests/UpdateErrorBoundary.test.tsx
- Modified files:
  - src/App.tsx (added error boundary wrapper)

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during this implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Added error boundary implementation
- Updated component structure documentation
- Added test coverage for error scenarios

## Next Steps
1. Test auto-update functionality in production environment
2. Verify error boundary behavior with real update errors
3. Consider adding retry mechanism for failed updates
4. Add telemetry for update errors to track issues

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Error boundary is in place and tested
- Auto-update implementation follows correct IPC patterns
- Event handlers are properly typed and cleaned up
- Consider implementing retry logic in next session
