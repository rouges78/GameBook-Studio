## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the auto-update functionality with retry mechanism and improved error handling.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented retry mechanism for auto-updates:
   - Added retry logic in useAutoUpdater hook
   - Enhanced error handling with retry counts
   - Added delay between retry attempts
   - Maximum retry limit of 3 attempts

2. Updated UI components:
   - Enhanced UpdateNotification to show error states
   - Added retry button with loading state
   - Improved error messaging with attempt counts
   - Dark mode compatible error states

3. Added comprehensive testing:
   - Created useAutoUpdater.test.ts for hook testing
   - Created UpdateNotification.test.tsx for component testing
   - Coverage for error states and retry scenarios
   - Integration tests with error boundary

### Implementation Details
- Retry mechanism uses exponential backoff with 2-second initial delay
- Error states include attempt counts (e.g., "Attempt 2 of 3")
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Integration with existing error boundary
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript

### Code Changes
- Modified files:
  - src/hooks/useAutoUpdater.ts (added retry logic)
  - src/components/UpdateNotification/index.tsx (enhanced UI)
  - src/components/UpdateNotification/types.ts (added error types)
  - src/App.tsx (added retry props)
- New files:
  - tests/useAutoUpdater.test.ts
  - tests/UpdateNotification.test.tsx

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during this implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Added error handling documentation
- Updated component API documentation
- Added test coverage documentation

## Next Steps
1. Monitor retry mechanism in production:
   - Track retry success rates
   - Analyze common failure patterns
   - Adjust retry delays if needed

2. Consider enhancements:
   - Add telemetry for update errors
   - Implement custom retry delays per error type
   - Add user notification preferences
   - Consider implementing offline mode handling

3. Future improvements:
   - Add more granular error reporting
   - Implement progressive backoff strategy
   - Add manual update check option
   - Consider implementing update deferral

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Retry mechanism is in place and tested
- Error states are properly handled
- Consider monitoring tools for production
- May need to adjust retry parameters based on real-world usage
