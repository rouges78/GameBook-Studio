## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the auto-update functionality with telemetry tracking to monitor update errors and user interactions.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented telemetry infrastructure:
   - Created TelemetryManager singleton class
   - Added event queuing and batching
   - Implemented IPC handlers for telemetry events
   - Added telemetry status management

2. Enhanced auto-update functionality with telemetry:
   - Added telemetry tracking for all update events
   - Implemented error tracking with retry information
   - Added tracking for user interactions (dismiss, retry)
   - Enhanced progress tracking

3. Added comprehensive testing:
   - Created telemetry mocks
   - Added tests for telemetry event tracking
   - Enhanced existing tests with telemetry verification
   - Added coverage for error tracking scenarios

### Implementation Details
- Telemetry events are queued and flushed every minute or when queue reaches 100 events
- Events include timestamps and relevant metadata
- Error tracking includes retry counts and delay information
- Events are stored in user data directory with daily rotation
- Telemetry can be enabled/disabled through IPC

### Code Changes
- Added files:
  - src/utils/telemetry.ts (telemetry manager)
  - electron/telemetry.ts (main process handler)
- Modified files:
  - electron/main.js (added telemetry IPC handlers)
  - electron/preload.ts (exposed telemetry methods)
  - electron/types.d.ts (added telemetry types)
  - src/hooks/useAutoUpdater.ts (integrated telemetry)
  - tests/useAutoUpdater.test.ts (added telemetry tests)

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during this implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Added telemetry infrastructure documentation
- Updated auto-update documentation with telemetry details
- Added test coverage documentation

## Next Steps
1. Monitor telemetry data:
   - Set up data analysis pipeline
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Define alert thresholds

2. Consider enhancements:
   - Add more granular event tracking
   - Implement custom event categories
   - Add user opt-out functionality
   - Consider privacy policy updates

3. Future improvements:
   - Add telemetry for other features
   - Implement real-time monitoring
   - Add error pattern analysis
   - Consider implementing A/B testing

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Telemetry infrastructure is in place and tested
- Auto-update telemetry is fully integrated
- Consider monitoring tools implementation
- May need to add user notification about telemetry
