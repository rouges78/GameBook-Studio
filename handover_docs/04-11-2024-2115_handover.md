## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing a telemetry monitoring dashboard to visualize and analyze telemetry data collected from the auto-update functionality and other system events.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created TelemetryDashboard component:
   - Implemented data fetching from telemetry logs
   - Added overview statistics
   - Created visualizations for update errors
   - Added event category breakdown

2. Added IPC infrastructure:
   - Added getAllTelemetryData method to TelemetryService
   - Added get-telemetry-data IPC handler
   - Updated types and preload script

3. Integrated dashboard into application:
   - Added to App component routing
   - Added navigation in Sidebar
   - Added translations for new feature

### Implementation Details
- Dashboard shows:
  - Total event count
  - Time range of collected data
  - Update error statistics
  - Event category breakdown
- Data is automatically refreshed when dashboard is opened
- Supports dark/light mode themes
- Includes error handling and loading states

### Code Changes
- Added files:
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/index.tsx
- Modified files:
  - electron/telemetry.ts (added getAllTelemetryData method)
  - electron/main.js (added get-telemetry-data IPC handler)
  - electron/types.d.ts (added new types)
  - electron/preload.ts (exposed new method)
  - src/App.tsx (added dashboard routing)
  - src/components/Sidebar.tsx (added dashboard navigation)

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during this implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Added telemetry dashboard documentation
- Updated IPC documentation with new methods
- Updated component documentation

## Next Steps
1. Add more visualizations:
   - Time-based event graphs
   - Error pattern analysis
   - User interaction flows
   - System performance metrics

2. Enhance filtering capabilities:
   - Add date range filters
   - Add category filters
   - Add search functionality
   - Add export capabilities

3. Add real-time updates:
   - Implement WebSocket for live updates
   - Add real-time alerts
   - Add notification system

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Basic telemetry dashboard is implemented and functional
- Consider adding more advanced visualizations
- May need to implement data pagination for large logs
- Consider adding data retention policies
