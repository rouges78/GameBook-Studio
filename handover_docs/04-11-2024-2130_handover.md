## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry dashboard with advanced visualizations to better understand user behavior and system performance.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Added time-based event graphs to TelemetryDashboard:
   - Installed recharts library for data visualization
   - Implemented daily event aggregation
   - Added responsive line chart visualization
   - Enhanced dark/light mode support for charts

### Implementation Details
- New Features:
  - Time series visualization showing events over time
  - Color-coded lines for different event categories
  - Interactive tooltips showing daily event counts
  - Responsive chart sizing
  - Dark/light mode theme support for chart elements

### Code Changes
- Added dependencies:
  - recharts: For creating interactive charts
- Modified files:
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/index.tsx:
    - Added time series data processing
    - Implemented LineChart component
    - Enhanced layout for better visualization
    - Added chart theming support

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during this implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Updated TelemetryDashboard component documentation with new visualization features

## Next Steps
1. Continue enhancing visualizations:
   - Add error pattern analysis
   - Add system performance metrics
   - Add user interaction flows

2. Implement filtering capabilities:
   - Add date range filters
   - Add category filters
   - Add search functionality
   - Add export capabilities

3. Add real-time updates:
   - Implement WebSocket for live updates
   - Add real-time alerts
   - Add notification system

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Time-based event visualization is now implemented
- Consider adding more interactive features to the charts
- Consider adding data export functionality for the visualizations
- May need to optimize performance for large datasets
