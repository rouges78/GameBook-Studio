## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry dashboard with advanced visualizations and fixing IPC communication issues.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Added time-based event graphs to TelemetryDashboard:
   - Installed recharts library for data visualization
   - Implemented daily event aggregation
   - Added responsive line chart visualization
   - Enhanced dark/light mode support for charts

2. Fixed IPC communication issues:
   - Standardized telemetry method names across the application
   - Updated method name from 'get-telemetry-data' to 'telemetry:getData'
   - Updated all related files for consistency:
     - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/index.tsx
     - electron/preload.ts
     - electron/main.js
     - src/types/electron.d.ts

### Implementation Details
- New Features:
  - Time series visualization showing events over time
  - Color-coded lines for different event categories
  - Interactive tooltips showing daily event counts
  - Responsive chart sizing
  - Dark/light mode theme support for chart elements

- Technical Improvements:
  - Consistent IPC method naming convention
  - Type-safe telemetry data handling
  - Improved error handling and loading states

### Code Changes
- Added dependencies:
  - recharts: For creating interactive charts
- Modified files:
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/index.tsx:
    - Added time series data processing
    - Implemented LineChart component
    - Updated IPC method name
  - electron/preload.ts:
    - Updated telemetry method name
  - electron/main.js:
    - Updated IPC handler name
  - src/types/electron.d.ts:
    - Updated ElectronAPI interface

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to inconsistent IPC method names
- Resolved type safety issues in telemetry data handling

## Documentation Updates
- Updated TelemetryDashboard component documentation
- Updated IPC communication documentation
- Updated type definitions

## Next Steps
1. Continue enhancing visualizations:
   - Add error pattern analysis
   - Add system performance metrics
   - Add user interaction flows

2. Implement filtering capabilities:
   - Add date range filters
   - Add category filters
   - Add search functionality
   - Add export capabilities

3. Add real-time updates:
   - Implement WebSocket for live updates
   - Add real-time alerts
   - Add notification system

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Time-based event visualization is now implemented and working
- IPC communication is now consistent and type-safe
- Consider adding more interactive features to the charts
- Consider adding data export functionality
- May need to optimize performance for large datasets
- Consider implementing data caching for better performance
