## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry dashboard with advanced visualizations and filtering capabilities.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented date range filtering for telemetry data:
   - Added date picker inputs with dark/light mode support
   - Implemented date range state management
   - Added data filtering logic based on selected date range
   - Updated UI to show filtered statistics
   - Maintained responsive design and theme consistency

### Implementation Details
- New Features:
  - Date range picker with min/max date validation
  - Real-time data filtering
  - Automatic initial date range based on available data
  - Responsive layout for filter controls
  - Dark/light mode support for date inputs

- Technical Improvements:
  - Added DateRange interface for type safety
  - Implemented separate state for filtered stats
  - Added effect hook for filtering data
  - Enhanced data processing to support filtering
  - Maintained existing chart functionality with filtered data

### Code Changes
- Modified files:
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/index.tsx:
    - Added date range state and interface
    - Added date picker UI components
    - Implemented filtering logic
    - Updated stats display to use filtered data
    - Enhanced dark/light mode support

## Issues and Resolutions
- No significant issues encountered during implementation
- Ensured date range validation to prevent invalid selections
- Maintained performance with efficient filtering

## Documentation Updates
- Updated TelemetryDashboard component documentation with new filtering capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Continue enhancing filtering capabilities:
   - Add category filters
   - Add search functionality
   - Add export capabilities

2. Implement error pattern analysis:
   - Add error correlation analysis
   - Add error trend visualization
   - Add error impact assessment

3. Add system performance metrics:
   - Add CPU usage tracking
   - Add memory usage tracking
   - Add response time metrics
   - Add error rate tracking

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Date range filtering is now implemented and working
- Consider adding presets for common date ranges (last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)
- Consider adding animation for chart updates when filter changes
- May need to optimize performance for larger datasets
- Consider adding loading state for filter operations
