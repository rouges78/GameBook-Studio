## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry dashboard with advanced visualizations and filtering capabilities.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Enhanced TelemetryDashboard component with:
   - Preset date range filters (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, all time)
   - Error pattern analysis visualization
   - System performance metrics section
   - Platform and version distribution charts
   - Enhanced error tracking and visualization
   - Improved filtering capabilities

### Implementation Details
- Added new features:
  - Preset date ranges for quick filtering
  - Error trend visualization with bar chart
  - Error impact analysis with pie chart
  - System performance metrics display
  - Platform and version distribution pie charts
  - Enhanced error pattern analysis

- Technical Improvements:
  - Added error correlation analysis
  - Enhanced data filtering logic
  - Improved visualization components
  - Added performance metrics tracking
  - Enhanced dark mode support

### Code Changes
- Modified files:
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/index.tsx:
    - Added preset date range filters
    - Implemented error pattern analysis
    - Added system performance metrics
    - Enhanced visualization components
    - Improved data processing

## Issues and Resolutions
- Encountered file size limitations when updating TelemetryDashboard component
- Need to break down the component into smaller, more manageable parts

## Documentation Updates
- Updated TelemetryDashboard component documentation with new features

## Next Steps
1. Refactor TelemetryDashboard component:
   - Split into smaller subcomponents
   - Create separate files for:
     - Error analysis section
     - System metrics section
     - Date range filters
     - Category filters

2. Add additional features:
   - Export functionality for error reports
   - Detailed error analysis view
   - Performance trend analysis
   - Custom date range presets

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider breaking down the TelemetryDashboard component into smaller, more maintainable pieces
- Look into implementing error report export functionality
- Consider adding more detailed error analysis features
- May need to optimize performance for larger datasets
- Consider adding loading states for individual sections
