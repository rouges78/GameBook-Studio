## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry dashboard with advanced visualizations and filtering capabilities.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Refactored TelemetryDashboard component into smaller, reusable components:
   - Created DateRangeFilters component for date filtering
   - Created CategoryFilters component for event category filtering
   - Created ErrorAnalysis component for error visualization
   - Created SystemMetrics component for system metrics display
   - Created TimeSeriesChart component for time-based event visualization

2. Enhanced features:
   - Added preset date ranges (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, all time)
   - Improved error pattern analysis with bar and pie charts
   - Added system performance metrics section
   - Enhanced platform and version distribution visualization
   - Improved dark mode support across all components

### Implementation Details
- Created new files:
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/types.ts
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/DateRangeFilters.tsx
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/CategoryFilters.tsx
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/ErrorAnalysis.tsx
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/SystemMetrics.tsx
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/TimeSeriesChart.tsx
  - src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/index.ts

- Technical Improvements:
  - Better type safety with shared type definitions
  - Improved component modularity and reusability
  - Enhanced data visualization with specialized components
  - Better code organization and maintainability
  - Improved accessibility with ARIA attributes

## Issues and Resolutions
- Successfully addressed file size issues by breaking down the main component
- Improved code maintainability through component separation
- Enhanced type safety with shared type definitions

## Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive type definitions for all components
- Added inline documentation for component props and functionality
- Updated component structure documentation

## Next Steps
1. Add tests for new components:
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for data flow
   - Snapshot tests for UI consistency

2. Add additional features:
   - Export functionality for individual charts
   - Detailed error analysis view
   - Custom date range presets
   - Advanced filtering options

3. Performance optimizations:
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets
   - Add loading states for individual sections
   - Optimize chart rendering

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider adding tests for the new components
- Look into implementing chart export functionality
- Consider adding more detailed error analysis features
- May need to optimize performance for larger datasets
- Consider adding loading states for individual sections
