## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing comprehensive tests for the telemetry dashboard components to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created unit tests for TelemetryDashboard components:
   - DateRangeFilters.test.tsx
     - Testing date range selection
     - Testing preset range functionality
     - Testing dark mode styling
     - Testing min/max date constraints
   
   - CategoryFilters.test.tsx
     - Testing category toggle functionality
     - Testing enabled/disabled states
     - Testing dark mode styling
     - Testing accessibility features
   
   - ErrorAnalysis.test.tsx
     - Testing error pattern visualization
     - Testing chart rendering
     - Testing statistics display
     - Testing dark mode styling
   
   - SystemMetrics.test.tsx
     - Testing performance metrics display
     - Testing distribution charts
     - Testing percentage calculations
     - Testing dark mode styling
   
   - TimeSeriesChart.test.tsx
     - Testing time series data visualization
     - Testing category filtering
     - Testing chart colors
     - Testing dark mode styling

2. Implemented comprehensive test coverage:
   - Component rendering
   - User interactions
   - Data formatting
   - Style variations
   - Edge cases and error handling

### Implementation Details
- Added mock implementations for recharts components
- Created test utilities for common testing scenarios
- Ensured type safety across all test files
- Added tests for edge cases like empty data sets
- Implemented accessibility testing

## Issues and Resolutions
- Resolved TypeScript errors in TimeSeriesChart tests by adding required 'total' field to test data
- Successfully mocked complex chart components for testing
- Ensured consistent dark mode testing across components

## Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive test files for all TelemetryDashboard components
- Included detailed test cases and scenarios
- Added comments explaining test coverage

## Next Steps
1. Add integration tests:
   - Test component interactions
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test state management

2. Add performance tests:
   - Test chart rendering performance
   - Test data processing efficiency
   - Test component update cycles

3. Add export functionality:
   - Implement chart export feature
   - Add tests for export functionality
   - Support multiple export formats

4. Enhance error analysis:
   - Add detailed error inspection view
   - Implement error pattern recognition
   - Add error correlation analysis

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider implementing snapshot tests for visual regression testing
- Look into implementing chart export functionality
- Consider adding error pattern analysis features
- May need to optimize performance for larger datasets
- Consider adding loading states for individual sections
