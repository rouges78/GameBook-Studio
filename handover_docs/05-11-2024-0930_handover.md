## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing comprehensive tests for the telemetry dashboard components to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created integration tests for TelemetryDashboard:
   - Component loading and data display
   - Date range filtering functionality
   - Category filtering functionality
   - Search functionality with debounce
   - CSV export functionality
   - Error handling
   - System metrics updates
   - Dark mode styling

2. Implemented test improvements:
   - Added proper TypeScript types for mock data
   - Fixed document.createElement mocking
   - Added proper cleanup in beforeEach blocks
   - Added comprehensive assertions for all major features
   - Included edge case testing

3. Added development dependencies:
   - Installed @testing-library/user-event for better interaction testing

### Implementation Details
- Created mock telemetry data matching the TelemetryEvent interface
- Implemented proper mocking for window.electron API
- Added proper async/await handling with act() and waitFor()
- Included thorough testing of component interactions
- Added proper cleanup for mocks and spies

## Issues and Resolutions
- Resolved TypeScript errors in mock data by removing 'id' property
- Fixed document.createElement mock implementation
- Added proper type definitions for all test data

## Documentation Updates
- Added TelemetryDashboard.integration.test.tsx with comprehensive test cases
- Updated test documentation with new integration tests
- Maintained consistent testing patterns across components

## Next Steps
1. Add performance tests:
   - Test chart rendering performance
   - Test data processing efficiency
   - Test component update cycles

2. Add export functionality:
   - Implement chart export feature
   - Add tests for export functionality
   - Support multiple export formats

3. Enhance error analysis:
   - Add detailed error inspection view
   - Implement error pattern recognition
   - Add error correlation analysis

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider adding snapshot tests for visual regression testing
- Look into implementing chart export functionality
- Consider adding error pattern analysis features
- May need to optimize performance for larger datasets
- Consider adding loading states for individual sections
- Review test coverage and add tests for edge cases if needed
