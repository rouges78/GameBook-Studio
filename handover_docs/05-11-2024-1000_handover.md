## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance tests for the telemetry dashboard components to ensure efficient handling of large datasets and responsive user interactions.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created comprehensive performance tests for TelemetryDashboard:
   - Initial render performance with large datasets (1000 events)
   - Search filtering efficiency
   - Date range filter performance
   - Category filter updates
   - Chart rendering performance with 2000 events
   - Concurrent filter updates handling

2. Implemented test scenarios:
   - Render time measurements
   - Filter operation timing
   - Chart update performance
   - Concurrent operations handling
   - Memory usage optimization

3. Added performance benchmarks:
   - Initial render: < 1000ms
   - Search filtering: < 100ms
   - Date filtering: < 100ms
   - Category filtering: < 100ms
   - Chart updates: < 200ms
   - Concurrent updates: < 300ms

### Implementation Details
- Created generateTestData helper for consistent test data generation
- Implemented Jest timer mocks for debounce testing
- Added performance.now() measurements
- Set up realistic performance thresholds
- Added cleanup in afterEach blocks

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during performance test implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/TelemetryDashboard.performance.test.tsx with comprehensive performance test cases
- Maintained consistent testing patterns with existing integration tests

## Next Steps
1. Implement chart export functionality:
   - Add PNG/SVG export options
   - Implement chart snapshot feature
   - Add tests for export functionality

2. Enhance error analysis:
   - Create detailed error inspection view
   - Implement error pattern recognition
   - Add error correlation analysis

3. Add loading states:
   - Implement skeleton loading for charts
   - Add loading indicators for filters
   - Create smooth transitions

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider implementing React.memo for optimizing re-renders
- Look into using Web Workers for heavy data processing
- Consider implementing virtualization for large datasets
- May need to add memory usage monitoring
- Consider adding performance monitoring in production
