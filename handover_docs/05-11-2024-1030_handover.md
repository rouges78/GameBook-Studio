## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing chart export functionality for the telemetry dashboard to allow users to save and share visualizations.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented chart export functionality:
   - Added PNG and SVG export options
   - Created utility functions for chart export
   - Implemented export buttons in TimeSeriesChart
   - Added proper error handling
   - Included dark mode support for export UI

2. Created comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for chart export utilities
   - Component tests for TimeSeriesChart export functionality
   - Integration tests for export workflow
   - Error handling tests
   - Dark mode styling tests

3. Added TypeScript improvements:
   - Created proper type definitions for test environment
   - Updated tsconfig.json for better type support
   - Added WebviewTag type handling for Electron
   - Improved type safety in test mocks

### Implementation Details
- Created chartExport.ts utility with SVG to PNG conversion
- Added export buttons to TimeSeriesChart component
- Implemented proper cleanup for object URLs
- Added background handling for exported charts
- Included filename generation with timestamps

## Issues and Resolutions
- Resolved TypeScript errors with createElement mock implementation
- Fixed WebviewTag type conflicts in test environment
- Added proper type definitions for test environment

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/types/jest.d.ts with test type definitions
- Updated tsconfig.json to include test directories
- Added comprehensive test files:
  - chartExport.test.ts
  - TimeSeriesChart.test.tsx (updated)

## Next Steps
1. Enhance error analysis view:
   - Create detailed error inspection modal
   - Implement error pattern recognition
   - Add error correlation analysis
   - Add tests for new functionality

2. Add loading states:
   - Implement skeleton loading for charts
   - Add loading indicators for filters
   - Create smooth transitions
   - Add tests for loading states

3. Optimize performance:
   - Implement React.memo for chart components
   - Add Web Worker for heavy data processing
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets
   - Add performance monitoring

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider adding export progress indicator for large datasets
- Look into implementing chart annotations
- Consider adding batch export functionality
- May need to add error boundary for export failures
- Consider adding export format preferences in user settings
