# Handover Document - November 5, 2024, 10:45

## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. The project is currently focused on enhancing the telemetry dashboard with improved error analysis capabilities and performance optimizations.

## Current Progress

### Starting Point
Based on previous handover (10:30):
- Chart export functionality has been completed with PNG/SVG support
- Comprehensive tests are in place for chart exports
- TypeScript improvements have been implemented

### Next Tasks to Address
1. Error Analysis Enhancement:
   - Create detailed error inspection modal
   - Implement error pattern recognition
   - Add error correlation analysis
   - Add tests for new functionality

2. Loading State Implementation:
   - Implement skeleton loading for charts
   - Add loading indicators for filters
   - Create smooth transitions
   - Add tests for loading states

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement React.memo for chart components
   - Add Web Worker for heavy data processing
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets
   - Add performance monitoring

## Issues and Resolutions
No new issues to report at session start.

## Documentation Updates
Created this handover document to track session progress.

## Next Steps
Will begin with the error analysis enhancement tasks:
1. Design and implement the error inspection modal
2. Add error pattern recognition logic
3. Implement correlation analysis
4. Create comprehensive tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
Continuing from previous notes:
- Consider adding export progress indicator for large datasets
- Look into implementing chart annotations
- Consider adding batch export functionality
- May need to add error boundary for export failures
- Consider adding export format preferences in user settings
