## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry dashboard with improved error analysis capabilities, loading states, and performance optimizations.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Error Inspection Modal:
   - Created ErrorInspectionModal component with detailed error analysis
   - Added time-based pattern visualization
   - Implemented platform distribution analysis
   - Added recent occurrences table
   - Included dark mode support

2. Enhanced Error Analysis Component:
   - Added interactive elements to open modal
   - Implemented error pattern click handlers
   - Added "Analyze Trends" and "View Details" buttons
   - Integrated modal with existing error data

3. Added Comprehensive Tests:
   - Created ErrorInspectionModal.test.tsx with full coverage
   - Updated ErrorAnalysis.test.tsx for new functionality
   - Added dark mode styling tests
   - Included interaction tests for modal

4. Updated Types and Documentation:
   - Added ErrorInspectionModalProps interface
   - Updated ErrorAnalysisProps to include rawEvents
   - Added modal-related types
   - Updated component exports

### Implementation Details
- Modal shows detailed error information including:
  - Pattern details and occurrence count
  - Time-based pattern visualization
  - Platform distribution
  - Recent error occurrences table
- Added interactive elements in ErrorAnalysis:
  - Click handlers for error patterns
  - Analyze buttons for different sections
  - Error type click interactions

## Issues and Resolutions
No significant issues encountered during implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Updated src/components/TelemetryDashboard/types.ts with new interfaces
- Added new components to src/components/TelemetryDashboard/components/index.ts
- Created comprehensive test files:
  - tests/ErrorInspectionModal.test.tsx
  - Updated tests/ErrorAnalysis.test.tsx

## Next Steps
1. Implement Loading States:
   - Create skeleton loading components for charts
   - Add loading indicators for filters
   - Implement smooth transitions
   - Add loading state tests
   - Consider using React Suspense for code splitting

2. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement React.memo for chart components
   - Add Web Worker for heavy data processing
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Consider implementing request caching

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider adding error pattern recognition algorithms
- Look into implementing error correlation analysis
- May need to add error boundary for modal
- Consider adding export functionality for error reports
- Think about adding search/filter capabilities in the modal
- Consider adding pagination for error occurrences table
