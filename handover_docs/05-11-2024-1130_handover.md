## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing loading states and performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Loading States:
   - Created ChartSkeleton component for TimeSeriesChart
   - Created FiltersSkeleton component for filters
   - Created MetricsSkeleton component for SystemMetrics
   - Added loading prop support to all components
   - Added comprehensive tests for skeleton components
   - Implemented dark mode support for all skeletons

2. Component Updates:
   - Updated TimeSeriesChart to handle loading states
   - Updated DateRangeFilters with loading state support
   - Updated CategoryFilters with loading state support
   - Updated SystemMetrics with loading state support
   - Added backward compatibility for existing metrics formats
   - Enhanced test coverage for all components

### Implementation Details
1. ChartSkeleton:
   - Responsive design matching chart dimensions
   - Animated loading state with pulse effect
   - Dark mode support
   - Customizable dimensions

2. FiltersSkeleton:
   - Matches filter layout structure
   - Shows date range and category placeholders
   - Supports dark mode
   - Maintains accessibility

3. MetricsSkeleton:
   - Grid layout matching metrics display
   - Shows placeholder cards with title and value areas
   - Supports responsive design
   - Dark mode compatible

4. Component Loading States:
   - Non-blocking loading states
   - Smooth transitions
   - Maintained existing functionality
   - Enhanced type safety

## Issues and Resolutions
- Resolved TypeScript compatibility issues with metrics data structure
- Added support for both array and object-based metrics formats
- Fixed dark mode class application in tests
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels

## Documentation Updates
- Added loading state implementation details
- Updated component interfaces
- Enhanced test documentation
- Added dark mode styling documentation

## Next Steps
1. Performance Optimizations (Remaining):
   - Implement React.memo for chart components
   - Add Web Worker for heavy data processing
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Implement request caching

2. Additional Enhancements:
   - Consider adding error boundaries for loading states
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed data loads
   - Add loading state preferences in settings
   - Consider implementing loading state animations customization

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing performance optimizations
- Consider adding loading timeout handling
- May need to implement error states for failed data loads
- Think about adding loading progress indicators for long operations
- Consider implementing skeleton animation customization options
