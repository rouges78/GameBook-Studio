## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented React.memo Optimization:
   - Added memoization to TimeSeriesChart component
   - Created custom comparison function for props
   - Added comprehensive tests for memoization behavior
   - Ensured proper type safety for all props

2. Implemented Web Worker for Data Processing:
   - Created dataProcessor.worker.ts for heavy computations
   - Added support for all telemetry metrics
   - Implemented error handling and type safety
   - Added comprehensive worker tests

3. Data Processing Optimizations:
   - Moved data filtering to worker thread
   - Optimized metrics calculations
   - Added error pattern analysis
   - Implemented system metrics processing
   - Added update error tracking

### Implementation Details
1. Web Worker Implementation:
   - Handles date range filtering
   - Processes category filters
   - Calculates error patterns and trends
   - Computes system metrics
   - Manages update error statistics

2. Data Processing Flow:
   - Raw events → Worker conversion → Processing → UI updates
   - Asynchronous processing to prevent UI blocking
   - Type-safe data transfer between threads
   - Efficient memory usage

3. Component Optimizations:
   - Memoized render optimizations
   - Efficient prop comparison
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - Improved type safety

## Issues and Resolutions
- Resolved type mismatches between TelemetryEvent and worker data
- Fixed metrics calculation type safety
- Improved error handling in worker communication
- Enhanced data transformation reliability

## Documentation Updates
- Added Web Worker implementation details
- Updated component optimization documentation
- Enhanced type definitions
- Added performance considerations

## Next Steps
1. Implement Virtualization:
   - Add virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Implement row virtualization in tables
   - Add column virtualization where applicable
   - Optimize DOM node count

2. Add Request Caching:
   - Implement caching layer for API requests
   - Add cache invalidation strategy
   - Implement cache size limits
   - Add cache persistence

3. Performance Monitoring:
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Implement monitoring dashboard
   - Add performance regression tests
   - Set up performance budgets

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing virtualization for large datasets
- Consider using react-window or react-virtualized
- May need to modify data structures for efficient virtualization
- Consider implementing progressive loading for large datasets
- Think about adding performance monitoring hooks
