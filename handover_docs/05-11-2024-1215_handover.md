## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented React.memo Optimization:
   - Added memoization to TimeSeriesChart component
   - Created custom comparison function for props
   - Added comprehensive tests for memoization behavior
   - Ensured proper type safety for all props

2. Implemented Web Worker for Data Processing:
   - Created dataProcessor.worker.ts for heavy computations
   - Added support for all telemetry metrics
   - Implemented error handling and type safety
   - Added comprehensive worker tests

3. Data Processing Optimizations:
   - Moved data filtering to worker thread
   - Optimized metrics calculations
   - Added error pattern analysis
   - Implemented system metrics processing
   - Added update error tracking

4. Implemented Virtualization for Error Events:
   - Created VirtualizedErrorTable component using react-window
   - Replaced static table in ErrorInspectionModal with virtualized version
   - Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Added comprehensive tests for the virtualized table
   - Improved performance for large error datasets

### Implementation Details
1. VirtualizedErrorTable Implementation:
   - Uses FixedSizeList from react-window
   - Handles dynamic data loading
   - Maintains consistent row heights
   - Supports dark/light mode theming
   - Preserves table header visibility

2. Error Inspection Modal Updates:
   - Integrated virtualized table component
   - Improved scrolling performance
   - Maintained existing functionality
   - Enhanced UI responsiveness

3. Testing Coverage:
   - Added unit tests for VirtualizedErrorTable
   - Included dark mode testing
   - Added empty state handling
   - Verified proper event rendering

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed type mismatches in TelemetryEvent mock data
- Improved table header styling consistency
- Enhanced dark mode compatibility
- Optimized row height calculations

## Documentation Updates
- Added virtualization implementation details
- Updated component documentation
- Enhanced type definitions
- Added performance optimization notes

## Next Steps
1. Extend Virtualization:
   - Add virtualization to CategoryFilters component
   - Implement virtualized scrolling for TimeSeriesChart
   - Add horizontal virtualization where applicable
   - Consider virtualization for SystemMetrics component

2. Add Request Caching:
   - Implement caching layer for API requests
   - Add cache invalidation strategy
   - Implement cache size limits
   - Add cache persistence

3. Performance Monitoring:
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Implement monitoring dashboard
   - Add performance regression tests
   - Set up performance budgets

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing virtualization for CategoryFilters component
- Consider using FixedSizeGrid for two-dimensional virtualization
- Look into implementing infinite loading for TimeSeriesChart
- Consider adding resize observers for responsive virtualization
- Think about implementing progressive loading for large datasets
