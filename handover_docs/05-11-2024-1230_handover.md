## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, with a focus on virtualizing components for better performance with large datasets.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Virtualization for CategoryFilters:
   - Added react-window FixedSizeList implementation
   - Created optimized row renderer component
   - Maintained dark mode support
   - Preserved existing functionality
   - Added comprehensive tests
   - Improved performance for large category lists

### Implementation Details
1. CategoryFilters Component Updates:
   - Added virtualization with fixed item height (32px)
   - Set maximum list height (300px)
   - Implemented smooth scrolling
   - Added border and rounded corners
   - Maintained accessibility features
   - Added proper TypeScript types

2. Testing Coverage:
   - Added virtualization-specific tests
   - Updated existing tests for new implementation
   - Added memoization tests
   - Verified dark mode compatibility
   - Added scroll behavior tests
   - Tested empty state handling

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implemented React.memo
   - Added useMemo for data processing
   - Optimized callback functions
   - Added proper TypeScript types
   - Maintained accessibility

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test mocks
- Improved ref handling in virtualized list
- Enhanced test coverage for virtualization
- Maintained existing functionality while adding virtualization

## Documentation Updates
- Updated CategoryFilters component documentation
- Added virtualization implementation notes
- Enhanced type definitions
- Updated test documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement Virtualization for TimeSeriesChart:
   - Add horizontal virtualization for data points
   - Implement smooth scrolling
   - Add performance optimizations
   - Maintain zoom functionality
   - Add proper TypeScript types

2. Add Request Caching:
   - Implement caching layer for API requests
   - Add cache invalidation strategy
   - Implement cache size limits
   - Add cache persistence

3. Performance Monitoring:
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Implement monitoring dashboard
   - Add performance regression tests
   - Set up performance budgets

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing virtualization for TimeSeriesChart
- Consider using canvas-based rendering for better performance
- Look into implementing WebGL rendering for large datasets
- Think about implementing progressive loading for historical data
- Consider adding WebWorker for data processing
