## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, focusing on virtualization for better performance with large datasets.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Virtualization for TimeSeriesChart:
   - Added custom virtualization hook (useChartVirtualization)
   - Implemented horizontal data windowing
   - Added smooth scrolling support
   - Implemented zoom functionality
   - Added WebGL rendering optimizations
   - Maintained dark mode support
   - Added comprehensive tests

### Implementation Details
1. useChartVirtualization Hook:
   - Handles data windowing based on visible viewport
   - Manages smooth scrolling with debounce
   - Supports zoom functionality with scale limits
   - Implements performance optimizations with memoization
   - Provides proper TypeScript types

2. TimeSeriesChart Component Updates:
   - Integrated virtualization hook
   - Added scroll and zoom event handlers
   - Maintained existing functionality (categories, dark mode)
   - Improved performance with disabled animations
   - Added proper TypeScript types

3. Testing Coverage:
   - Added virtualization-specific tests
   - Added scroll behavior tests
   - Added zoom functionality tests
   - Added performance optimization tests
   - Maintained existing test coverage

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors with TimeSeriesData interface
- Improved type safety across components
- Enhanced scroll performance with debouncing
- Maintained proper cleanup of event listeners

## Documentation Updates
- Added useChartVirtualization hook documentation
- Updated TimeSeriesChart component documentation
- Enhanced type definitions
- Updated test documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement Request Caching:
   - Add caching layer for API requests
   - Implement cache invalidation strategy
   - Add cache size limits
   - Add cache persistence

2. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Implement monitoring dashboard
   - Add performance regression tests
   - Set up performance budgets

3. Optimize Data Processing:
   - Move heavy computations to WebWorker
   - Implement progressive loading
   - Add data compression
   - Optimize memory usage

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing request caching
- Consider using IndexedDB for cache persistence
- Look into implementing service workers for offline support
- Think about implementing progressive loading for historical data
- Consider adding WebWorker for data processing
- Monitor memory usage with large datasets
