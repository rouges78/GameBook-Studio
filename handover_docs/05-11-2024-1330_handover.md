## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, focusing on data caching and request optimization.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Telemetry Data Caching:
   - Added IndexedDB-based caching system
   - Implemented raw data caching
   - Added processed data caching with invalidation
   - Added cache size limits and cleanup
   - Integrated caching with useDataProcessor hook
   - Added comprehensive tests

### Implementation Details
1. TelemetryCache Service:
   - Uses IndexedDB for persistent storage
   - Implements two stores: raw-data and processed-data
   - Handles cache invalidation after 1 hour
   - Maintains cache size limit of 100 entries
   - Provides type-safe API

2. useDataProcessor Hook Updates:
   - Added cache integration
   - Implements cache-first strategy
   - Falls back to processing on cache miss
   - Maintains existing worker functionality
   - Added error handling for cache operations

3. Testing Coverage:
   - Added cache hit/miss tests
   - Added cache invalidation tests
   - Added error handling tests
   - Maintained existing test coverage
   - Added proper TypeScript types

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors with ProcessedTelemetryData interface
- Improved type safety across caching implementation
- Enhanced error handling for cache operations
- Maintained proper cleanup of cached data

## Documentation Updates
- Added TelemetryCache service documentation
- Updated useDataProcessor hook documentation
- Enhanced type definitions
- Updated test documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement Progressive Loading:
   - Add data pagination support
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Add loading indicators
   - Optimize memory usage

2. Add WebWorker Optimizations:
   - Move heavy computations to worker
   - Add worker pool for parallel processing
   - Implement worker communication protocol
   - Add worker error handling

3. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Add cache hit/miss metrics
   - Implement performance tracking
   - Add monitoring dashboard
   - Set up performance budgets

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing progressive loading
- Consider using intersection observer for virtualization
- Look into implementing worker pool
- Think about implementing data compression
- Consider adding cache analytics
- Monitor memory usage with large datasets
