## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, focusing on progressive loading and pagination.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Progressive Loading:
   - Added pagination support to data processor
   - Implemented paginated data loading
   - Added pagination controls to UI
   - Integrated with existing caching system
   - Added loading indicators

2. Updated Cache System:
   - Added pagination support to cache keys
   - Modified cache storage to handle paginated data
   - Updated cache invalidation logic
   - Added pagination metadata to cached results

3. Enhanced Data Processing:
   - Modified worker to handle paginated data
   - Optimized data filtering for large datasets
   - Added pagination metadata to processed results
   - Maintained existing metrics calculations

### Implementation Details
1. Pagination System:
   - Default page size: 50 items
   - Added page navigation controls
   - Implemented page state management
   - Added loading states for transitions
   - Maintained filter functionality

2. Cache Enhancements:
   - Added pagination to cache keys
   - Updated cache storage format
   - Modified data retrieval logic
   - Enhanced cache invalidation

3. UI Improvements:
   - Added pagination controls
   - Implemented loading indicators
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved user feedback

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors with pagination types
- Improved error handling for paginated data
- Enhanced loading states for better UX
- Maintained cache performance with pagination

## Documentation Updates
- Added pagination documentation
- Updated cache system documentation
- Enhanced type definitions
- Updated component documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement Worker Pool:
   - Add worker pool management
   - Implement parallel processing
   - Add worker communication protocol
   - Add error handling

2. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Add cache hit/miss metrics
   - Implement performance tracking
   - Add monitoring dashboard
   - Set up performance budgets

3. Optimize Memory Usage:
   - Implement data compression
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Optimize data structures
   - Add cleanup strategies

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing worker pool
- Consider adding performance metrics
- Look into data compression options
- Think about memory optimization
- Consider adding analytics for cache usage
- Monitor pagination performance
