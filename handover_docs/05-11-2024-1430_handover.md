## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, focusing on parallel processing through a worker pool system.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Worker Pool System:
   - Created WorkerPool class for managing multiple workers
   - Added task queue management
   - Implemented parallel processing capabilities
   - Added worker error handling
   - Integrated with existing data processor

2. Updated Data Processing:
   - Modified data processor to use worker pool
   - Added data chunking for parallel processing
   - Implemented result merging logic
   - Maintained existing metrics calculations
   - Added pool statistics tracking

3. Added Testing:
   - Created worker pool unit tests
   - Added parallel execution tests
   - Implemented error handling tests
   - Added pool management tests
   - Tested hardware concurrency support

### Implementation Details
1. Worker Pool Features:
   - Dynamic pool size based on hardware
   - Task queuing system
   - Worker lifecycle management
   - Error propagation
   - Pool statistics

2. Data Processing Enhancements:
   - Chunk-based data distribution
   - Parallel processing support
   - Result aggregation
   - Cache integration
   - Performance monitoring

3. Testing Coverage:
   - Worker pool creation
   - Parallel task execution
   - Task queuing behavior
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Pool statistics accuracy

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors in worker pool implementation
- Improved error handling in parallel processing
- Enhanced type safety in test files
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Optimized memory usage

## Documentation Updates
- Added worker pool documentation
- Updated data processing docs
- Enhanced type definitions
- Added test documentation
- Updated implementation notes

## Next Steps
1. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Implement worker timing metrics
   - Add task execution tracking
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Track cache effectiveness
   - Set up performance alerts

2. Optimize Memory Usage:
   - Implement data compression
   - Add cleanup strategies
   - Optimize data structures
   - Monitor memory patterns
   - Add memory limits

3. Enhance Error Recovery:
   - Add worker restart logic
   - Implement task retry system
   - Add circuit breaker pattern
   - Improve error reporting
   - Add recovery strategies

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing performance monitoring
- Consider adding memory optimization
- Look into error recovery mechanisms
- Think about scaling strategies
- Monitor worker pool effectiveness
- Consider adding worker specialization
