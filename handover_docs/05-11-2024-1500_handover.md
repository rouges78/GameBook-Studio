## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing performance optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, with a focus on worker pool performance monitoring and metrics collection.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Enhanced Worker Pool with Performance Monitoring:
   - Added task timing metrics
   - Implemented task history tracking
   - Added memory usage monitoring
   - Enhanced statistics reporting
   - Implemented performance metrics calculation

2. Added Performance Metrics:
   - Task execution timing
   - Success/failure rates
   - Average execution time
   - Peak memory usage tracking
   - Task history with size limits

3. Implemented Testing:
   - Added worker pool performance tests
   - Created memory tracking tests
   - Added task history tests
   - Implemented error handling tests
   - Added queue management tests

### Implementation Details
1. Performance Monitoring Features:
   - Task timing using performance.now()
   - Memory usage tracking via performance.memory
   - Task history with 100-entry limit
   - Comprehensive statistics calculation
   - Error tracking and reporting

2. Testing Coverage:
   - Worker initialization
   - Task execution timing
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Queue management
   - Task history limits

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors in worker pool implementation
- Added proper type declarations for Performance API
- Enhanced error worker mock for testing
- Improved type safety in test files
- Fixed memory tracking type issues

## Documentation Updates
- Added performance monitoring documentation
- Updated worker pool implementation notes
- Enhanced type definitions
- Added test documentation
- Updated performance metrics docs

## Next Steps
1. Implement Memory Optimization:
   - Add data compression
   - Implement cleanup strategies
   - Add memory limits
   - Monitor memory patterns
   - Implement garbage collection triggers

2. Add Error Recovery:
   - Implement worker restart logic
   - Add task retry system
   - Implement circuit breaker
   - Add recovery strategies
   - Enhance error reporting

3. Enhance Monitoring:
   - Add real-time metrics display
   - Implement alerts system
   - Add performance thresholds
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Add metric exporters

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing memory optimization features
- Consider adding worker restart mechanisms
- Look into data compression strategies
- Think about monitoring visualization
- Consider adding performance alerts
- Review memory usage patterns
