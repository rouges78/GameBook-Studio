## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing memory optimizations for the telemetry dashboard, focusing on data compression and memory management.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Enhanced Worker Pool Memory Management:
   - Added memory thresholds and monitoring
   - Implemented worker cleanup strategies
   - Added memory-based task scheduling
   - Implemented worker restart mechanisms
   - Added performance metrics tracking

2. Implemented Data Compression:
   - Added compression for large payloads (>50KB)
   - Implemented compression in worker communication
   - Added compression threshold configuration
   - Enhanced data transfer efficiency
   - Optimized memory usage

3. Added Memory Safety Features:
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Automatic garbage collection triggers
   - Worker pool size management
   - Task queue memory limits
   - Memory-aware task scheduling

### Implementation Details
1. Memory Management Features:
   - Memory thresholds (warning: 150MB, critical: 250MB, maximum: 300MB)
   - Periodic garbage collection (30s intervals)
   - Worker restart with exponential backoff
   - Task history size limits
   - Memory usage tracking

2. Compression Implementation:
   - Using pako for compression
   - Compression threshold: 50KB
   - Automatic compression for large payloads
   - Bidirectional compression support
   - Optimized data transfer

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors in worker pool implementation
- Added proper type declarations for compressed data
- Enhanced error handling for worker restarts
- Improved memory monitoring accuracy
- Added compression error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Updated worker pool implementation notes
- Added compression documentation
- Enhanced memory management docs
- Updated type definitions
- Added performance monitoring docs

## Next Steps
1. Implement Memory Alerts:
   - Add real-time memory monitoring
   - Implement alert thresholds
   - Add notification system
   - Create alert dashboard
   - Add alert history

2. Enhance Error Recovery:
   - Add circuit breaker pattern
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Add recovery strategies
   - Enhance error reporting
   - Add automatic recovery

3. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Add real-time metrics
   - Implement trend analysis
   - Add performance alerts
   - Create performance reports

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing memory alerts system
- Consider adding real-time monitoring visualization
- Look into implementing circuit breaker pattern
- Think about alert notification strategies
- Consider adding performance trend analysis
- Review memory usage patterns in production
