## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing memory monitoring and alert system for the telemetry dashboard, focusing on real-time visualization and trend analysis.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Enhanced Memory Alerts Panel:
   - Added real-time memory usage visualization using Chart.js
   - Implemented trend analysis for memory usage patterns
   - Added interactive trend analysis display
   - Enhanced alert history display with color-coded status
   - Added memory usage chart with real-time updates

2. Memory Visualization Features:
   - Real-time memory usage line chart
   - Historical data tracking (up to 20 points)
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Responsive chart sizing
   - Memory usage trend indicators

3. Alert System Improvements:
   - Color-coded alert levels
   - Detailed memory usage information
   - Timestamp tracking
   - Clear alert history functionality
   - Trend analysis with percentage changes

### Implementation Details
1. Chart.js Integration:
   - Added chart.js and react-chartjs-2 dependencies
   - Configured chart options for optimal display
   - Implemented real-time data updates
   - Added tooltips and formatting

2. Memory Trend Analysis:
   - Rolling window of recent memory points
   - Percentage-based trend calculation
   - Color-coded trend indicators
   - Trend direction detection
   - Usage pattern recommendations

3. Testing Implementation:
   - Unit tests for MemoryAlertsPanel
   - Mock data generation
   - Alert rendering tests
   - Trend analysis tests
   - Chart update tests

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors with chart.js dependencies
- Added proper type declarations
- Enhanced error handling for trend calculations
- Improved memory usage formatting
- Added error boundaries for chart rendering

## Documentation Updates
- Added test documentation for MemoryAlertsPanel
- Updated component documentation
- Added trend analysis documentation
- Enhanced type definitions
- Added usage examples

## Next Steps
1. Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern:
   - Add memory-based circuit breaker
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Add recovery strategies
   - Enhance error reporting
   - Add automatic recovery

2. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Create monitoring dashboard
   - Add real-time metrics
   - Implement trend analysis
   - Add performance alerts
   - Create performance reports

3. Enhance Error Recovery:
   - Add recovery strategies
   - Implement automatic retries
   - Add fallback mechanisms
   - Enhance error logging
   - Add recovery notifications

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Focus on implementing the circuit breaker pattern
- Consider adding more sophisticated trend analysis
- Look into implementing automatic recovery strategies
- Think about adding performance benchmarks
- Consider adding alert persistence
- Review memory usage patterns in production environment
