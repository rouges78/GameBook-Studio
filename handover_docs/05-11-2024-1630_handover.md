## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently implementing advanced telemetry features with circuit breaker pattern for improved system resilience.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks

1. Circuit Breaker Implementation:
   - Added CircuitBreaker class with three states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
   - Implemented automatic state transitions based on system health
   - Added comprehensive test suite for circuit breaker functionality
   - Integrated with worker pool for automatic failure handling

2. Worker Pool Enhancements:
   - Added circuit breaker integration for task execution control
   - Improved error handling with automatic recovery
   - Enhanced memory management with circuit breaker thresholds
   - Added success/failure tracking for circuit breaker decisions

3. Testing Coverage:
   - Unit tests for CircuitBreaker implementation
   - Integration tests for TelemetryDashboard
   - Performance tests for worker pool and data processing
   - Memory management tests
   - Error handling and recovery tests

4. Telemetry System Status:
   - Memory monitoring fully implemented
   - Real-time performance tracking operational
   - Error analysis system complete
   - Worker pool telemetry integrated
   - Circuit breaker monitoring active

### Implementation Details

1. Circuit Breaker Features:
   - Automatic state transitions
