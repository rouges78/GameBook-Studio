## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry system with detailed performance monitoring and predictive analytics capabilities.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created comprehensive test suite for DetailedPerformanceMetrics component:
   - Basic rendering tests
   - Circuit breaker state display tests
   - Metric cards display tests
   - Trend analysis tests
   - Chart data validation tests
   - Dark mode styling tests
   - Status color tests
   - Empty state handling tests

2. Test Coverage Areas:
   - Component rendering
   - Circuit breaker states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
   - Performance metrics display
   - Trend indicators
   - Predictions display
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Chart data structure
   - Dark mode styling

### Implementation Details
1. Test Structure:
   - Mock setup for Chart.js and HeroIcons
   - TypeScript interfaces for performance data
   - Comprehensive test cases for all component features
   - Edge case handling

2. Testing Approach:
   - Unit tests for component rendering
   - Integration tests for data processing
   - Visual elements verification
   - State management testing

## Issues and Resolutions
- Resolved TypeScript errors related to readonly arrays by properly typing test data
- Fixed circuit breaker state type issues
- Implemented proper mocking for Chart.js components

## Documentation Updates
- Added DetailedPerformanceMetrics.test.tsx with comprehensive test coverage
- Updated test documentation with new test cases

## Next Steps

1. Additional Test Coverage:
   - Add tests for utility functions (calculateTrend, predictNextValue, getMetricStatus)
   - Implement snapshot tests for visual regression
   - Add performance benchmarks for data processing
   - Create stress tests for large datasets

2. Component Enhancements:
   - Implement machine learning capabilities for better predictions
   - Add anomaly detection features
   - Enhance trend analysis algorithms
   - Add correlation analysis between metrics

3. Documentation:
   - Add JSDoc comments for utility functions
   - Create documentation for prediction algorithms
   - Document performance optimization techniques

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider implementing snapshot tests for visual regression testing
- Look into implementing machine learning capabilities for predictions
- Review performance impact of current implementation
- Consider adding more sophisticated trend analysis algorithms
