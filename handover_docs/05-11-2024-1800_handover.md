## Project Overview
GameBook Studio - An Electron-based application for creating interactive story books. Currently enhancing the telemetry system with detailed performance monitoring and predictive analytics capabilities.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created comprehensive test suite for data processor worker:
   - Unit tests for data processing functions
   - Type safety and error handling tests
   - Data filtering and pagination tests
   - Compression handling tests

2. Implemented snapshot tests for DetailedPerformanceMetrics component:
   - Basic rendering tests
   - Dark mode rendering tests
   - Empty state handling
   - Multiple data points rendering
   - Circuit breaker states visualization
   - High error rates visualization
   - High resource usage visualization

3. Added performance benchmarks and stress tests:
   - Processing time benchmarks for various data sizes
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Stress testing with rapid consecutive requests
   - Performance variance testing with different data patterns
   - Compression efficiency testing

### Implementation Details
1. Test Coverage Areas:
   - Data processor worker functionality
   - Component visual regression testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Stress handling capabilities

2. Testing Approach:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Snapshot tests for UI consistency
   - Performance tests with defined budgets
   - Memory leak detection
   - Stress tests for stability

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test files by properly typing processed data
- Resolved snapshot test issues by correcting component props
- Addressed memory usage concerns with proper cleanup in tests

## Documentation Updates
- Added detailed test files:
  - dataProcessor.worker.test.ts
  - DetailedPerformanceMetrics.snapshot.test.ts
  - dataProcessor.performance.test.ts

## Next Steps

1. Machine Learning Integration:
   - Implement machine learning capabilities for better predictions
   - Add anomaly detection features
   - Enhance trend analysis algorithms
   - Add correlation analysis between metrics

2. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add JSDoc comments for utility functions
   - Create documentation for prediction algorithms
   - Document performance optimization techniques

3. Additional Testing:
   - Add integration tests for ML features
   - Create end-to-end tests for telemetry system
   - Add more edge case tests
   - Implement real-time performance monitoring

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- Consider implementing machine learning models for prediction
- Look into using TensorFlow.js for anomaly detection
- Review performance impact of current implementation
- Consider adding more sophisticated trend analysis algorithms
- Think about implementing real-time alerts for performance issues
