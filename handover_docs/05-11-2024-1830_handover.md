## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We've been focusing on implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, which is a critical component allowing users to visualize and manage story flow.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tests
1. StoryMap Component Tests:
   - Core component rendering and functionality
   - Event handling (clicks, drags, keyboard shortcuts)
   - Integration with child components

2. useStoryMap Hook Tests:
   - State management
   - Node manipulation (add, remove, update)
   - Map interactions (pan, zoom, grid)
   - Save functionality

3. MiniMap Component Tests:
   - Viewport rendering and scaling
   - Navigation interactions
   - Node and link visualization
   - Aspect ratio maintenance

4. KeyboardShortcutsHelp Component Tests:
   - Modal functionality
   - Shortcut display
   - Accessibility features
   - UI interactions

### Test Coverage Areas
- User interactions
- State management
- Component integration
- Accessibility
- Error handling
- Performance considerations

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Fixed TypeScript errors in test files:
   - Corrected class assertions in tests
   - Updated event type definitions
   - Fixed component prop types

2. Improved test reliability:
   - Added proper cleanup in beforeEach blocks
   - Implemented correct mock implementations
   - Enhanced assertion specificity

## Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive test files:
  - tests/StoryMap.test.tsx
  - tests/useStoryMap.test.ts
  - tests/MiniMap.test.tsx
  - tests/KeyboardShortcutsHelp.test.tsx

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding tests for:
   - Edge cases in node positioning
   - Complex interaction scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Network error handling

2. Potential improvements:
   - Add snapshot tests for visual components
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Add stress tests for large story maps

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Test files are organized in the tests/ directory
2. All core components have basic test coverage
3. Mock implementations are available in tests/mocks/
4. Consider focusing on edge cases and error scenarios next
5. The testing infrastructure is set up and working correctly

## Additional Context
- The testing approach follows React Testing Library best practices
- Jest is configured and working properly
- TypeScript types are properly integrated with test files
- Component tests are isolated with proper mocking
