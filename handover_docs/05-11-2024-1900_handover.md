## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, focusing on edge cases and complex interactions to ensure robust functionality.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Added comprehensive node positioning tests in useStoryMap.test.ts:
   - Node initialization tests
     * Saved position loading
     * Default grid positioning
   - Boundary constraint tests
     * Edge padding validation
     * Locked node behavior
     * Drag mode restrictions
   - Zoom-related positioning tests
     * Position adjustments at different zoom levels
     * Boundary constraints with zoom

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Node Initialization
   - Proper loading of saved positions
   - Grid-based positioning for new nodes
   - Multiple node layout handling

2. Boundary Constraints
   - 30px padding enforcement
   - Position constraints during drag
   - Locked node immobility
   - Drag mode requirements

3. Zoom Interactions
   - Position calculations at different zoom levels
   - Boundary enforcement at min/max zoom
   - Drag distance scaling with zoom

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Identified and tested edge cases in node positioning:
   - Nodes cannot be dragged outside map bounds
   - Locked nodes remain immobile
   - Drag operations respect zoom level
   - Grid positioning handles multiple nodes correctly

## Documentation Updates
- Updated tests/useStoryMap.test.ts with comprehensive node positioning tests
- Added detailed test cases for edge scenarios and complex interactions

## Next Steps
1. Implement performance tests for:
   - Large numbers of nodes
   - Rapid drag operations
   - Zoom level changes
   - Pan operations

2. Add tests for complex interaction scenarios:
   - Multi-node selection
   - Concurrent operations
   - Network latency handling
   - Error recovery

3. Consider implementing:
   - Stress tests for map operations
   - Memory usage optimization tests
   - Animation performance tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. All basic node positioning tests are implemented
2. Test infrastructure is working correctly
3. Focus next on performance and stress testing
4. Consider adding visual regression tests for node positioning
5. May need to optimize node position calculations for large maps

## Additional Context
- Tests follow React Testing Library best practices
- Edge cases are now well-covered
- Performance testing framework needs to be set up next
- Consider adding snapshot tests for visual verification
