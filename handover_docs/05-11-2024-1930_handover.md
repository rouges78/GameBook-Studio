## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on performance testing and edge cases to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Fixed TypeScript issues in useStoryMap.test.ts:
   - Properly typed language prop as 'it' | 'en'
   - Added null checks for node positions
   - Fixed StoryMapProps type compatibility

2. Implemented comprehensive performance tests:
   - Rendering performance with large datasets (1000 nodes)
   - Zoom operation efficiency
   - Node position update performance
   - Drag operation responsiveness
   - Pan operation smoothness
   - Concurrent operation handling
   - Memory usage monitoring

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Performance Metrics
   - Initial render time (< 1000ms for 1000 nodes)
   - Zoom operation speed (10 operations < 500ms)
   - Node update performance (20 updates < 1000ms)
   - Drag operation responsiveness (50 events < 500ms)
   - Pan operation smoothness (50 events < 500ms)
   - Memory efficiency (< 50MB for 1000 nodes)

2. Edge Cases
   - Large dataset handling
   - Rapid consecutive operations
   - Concurrent operation management
   - Memory leak prevention

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Fixed TypeScript errors:
   - Added proper type constraints for language prop
   - Implemented null checks for node positions
   - Corrected props interface usage

2. Performance test considerations:
   - Added performance measurement using Performance API
   - Implemented memory usage tracking
   - Created test utilities for generating large datasets

## Documentation Updates
- Updated tests/StoryMap.performance.test.tsx with comprehensive performance tests
- Added detailed performance benchmarks and thresholds
- Documented memory usage expectations

## Next Steps
1. Implement stress tests:
   - Extreme node counts (5000+ nodes)
   - Rapid operation sequences
   - Long-running operation stability
   - Memory leak detection

2. Add network simulation tests:
   - Save operation under poor network conditions
   - Load operation with large datasets
   - Auto-backup reliability testing

3. Consider implementing:
   - CPU profiling tests
   - GPU performance monitoring
   - Animation frame rate tests
   - Load time optimization tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Performance test infrastructure is in place
2. Basic performance benchmarks are established
3. Memory usage monitoring is implemented
4. Consider adding more granular performance metrics
5. May need to adjust performance thresholds based on real-world usage

## Additional Context
- Tests use Performance API for accurate timing
- Memory metrics are Chrome-specific but gracefully handled
- Performance thresholds are initial estimates and may need adjustment
- Consider adding performance regression testing to CI/CD pipeline
