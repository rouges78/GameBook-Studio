## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on stress testing to ensure stability and performance under extreme conditions.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented comprehensive stress tests in StoryMap.stress.test.tsx:
   - Extreme load testing (5000+ nodes)
   - Rapid consecutive operations
   - Long-running operation stability
   - Memory leak detection
   - Error recovery testing

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Extreme Load Tests
     * Large node count rendering (5000+ nodes)
     * Rapid consecutive operations (100 operations)
   - Long-Running Operation Tests
     * Extended drag sessions (5 minutes)
     * Continuous zoom changes (1000 operations)
   - Memory Leak Tests
     * Extended operation memory stability
     * Garbage collection verification
   - Error Recovery Tests
     * Random error injection
     * State recovery verification

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Performance Under Load
   - Initial render under 3 seconds for 5000 nodes
   - 100 consecutive operations under 5 seconds
   - 60fps maintenance during zoom operations
   - Memory growth under 100MB during stress

2. Stability Metrics
   - Extended operation stability
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Error recovery capabilities
   - Resource cleanup verification

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added fake timers for long-running tests
   - Implemented memory tracking
   - Added error simulation
   - Enhanced cleanup procedures

2. Performance Thresholds:
   - Established baseline metrics
   - Set reasonable limits for extreme conditions
   - Added memory growth constraints
   - Defined recovery expectations

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.stress.test.tsx with comprehensive stress tests
- Documented performance thresholds and expectations
- Added memory management guidelines
- Included error recovery patterns

## Next Steps
1. Implement network simulation tests:
   - Save operations under poor conditions
   - Load testing with large datasets
   - Connection interruption handling
   - Retry mechanism testing

2. Add CPU profiling:
   - Operation CPU usage tracking
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Optimization opportunity detection
   - Resource utilization analysis

3. Consider implementing:
   - GPU performance monitoring
   - WebWorker stress testing
   - Animation performance analysis
   - Resource contention testing

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Stress test infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Memory tracking is implemented
4. Error recovery is tested
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use Jest fake timers for time-dependent operations
- Memory metrics are Chrome-specific but gracefully handled
- Error simulation is randomized for realistic scenarios
- Performance thresholds may need adjustment based on real-world usage
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
