## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on network resilience testing to ensure robust operation under various network conditions.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented network simulation tests in StoryMap.network.test.tsx:
   - Save operation tests under various network conditions
   - Load operation tests with connection issues
   - Auto-backup behavior tests during network problems

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Save Operations
     * Slow network handling
     * Unstable connection management
     * Offline state handling
   - Load Operations
     * Slow initial load behavior
     * Connection interruption recovery
   - Auto-backup Behavior
     * Backup scheduling during network issues
     * Missed backup recovery

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Network Conditions
   - Slow connections (3s delay)
   - Unstable connections (50% failure rate)
   - Complete offline state
   - Connection recovery scenarios

2. Data Operations
   - Large dataset loading (1000+ nodes)
   - Incremental saves during poor connectivity
   - Auto-backup retry mechanisms
   - Connection interruption recovery

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added network condition simulation
   - Implemented mock timing controls
   - Created retry mechanism testing
   - Enhanced error handling verification

2. Performance Thresholds:
   - Set load time expectations under poor network
   - Established save operation timing limits
   - Defined backup retry intervals
   - Added connection recovery metrics

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.network.test.tsx with comprehensive network tests
- Documented network simulation patterns
- Added retry mechanism documentation
- Included connection recovery strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement CPU profiling tests:
   - Operation CPU usage tracking
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Resource utilization analysis
   - Background task impact measurement

2. Add WebWorker tests:
   - Worker communication reliability
   - Task queue management
   - Error handling in workers
   - Worker resource usage

3. Consider implementing:
   - Network bandwidth tests
   - Concurrent operation tests
   - Data synchronization tests
   - Offline mode operation tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Network test infrastructure is in place
2. Network simulation patterns are established
3. Retry mechanisms are tested
4. Connection recovery is verified
5. Consider adding more network scenarios

## Additional Context
- Tests use Jest fake timers for network simulation
- Network conditions are simulated with Promise delays
- Error handling is tested with random failures
- Performance thresholds account for network conditions
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust network simulation parameters based on real-world conditions
