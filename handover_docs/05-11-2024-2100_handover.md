## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on CPU profiling and resource utilization testing to ensure optimal performance.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented CPU profiling tests in StoryMap.cpu.test.tsx:
   - CPU usage pattern tests
   - Resource utilization tests
   - Performance optimization tests
   - Memory allocation monitoring

2. Test Categories Added:
   - CPU Usage Patterns
     * Initial render efficiency
     * Rapid operation optimization
     * Background task handling
   - Resource Utilization
     * Memory allocation efficiency
     * Render cycle optimization
   - Performance Optimization
     * Memoization effectiveness
     * Concurrent operation handling

### Test Coverage Areas
1. CPU Performance
   - Initial render under 1000ms
   - Operation timing under 16ms (60fps)
   - Background task overhead under 100ms
   - Memory growth under 1KB per node

2. Resource Management
   - Memory allocation tracking
   - Render cycle batching
   - Memoization verification
   - Concurrent operation efficiency

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added CPU profiling utilities
   - Implemented memory tracking
   - Created performance measurement tools
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ProfileResult interface
   - Fixed Node type compatibility
   - Added proper null checks
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.cpu.test.tsx with comprehensive CPU tests
- Documented performance thresholds
- Added CPU profiling patterns
- Included memory management strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement WebWorker tests:
   - Worker communication
   - Task distribution
   - Error handling
   - Resource sharing

2. Add GPU profiling:
   - Rendering performance
   - Animation smoothness
   - Frame rate stability
   - Visual artifacts

3. Consider implementing:
   - Thread utilization tests
   - Task scheduling tests
   - Resource contention tests
   - Background process tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. CPU profiling infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Memory tracking is implemented
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use Performance API for timing
- Memory metrics are Chrome-specific but handled gracefully
- CPU profiling is simulated in test environment
- Performance thresholds may need adjustment
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on different hardware configurations
- Added helper functions for type conversion between ExtendedParagraph and Node
