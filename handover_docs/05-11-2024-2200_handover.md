## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on GPU profiling and visual performance testing to ensure smooth rendering and animations.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented GPU profiling tests in StoryMap.gpu.test.tsx:
   - Frame rate monitoring
   - Visual stability tests
   - Animation performance tests
   - Layout shift tracking

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Rendering Performance
     * Frame rate stability
     * Visual update efficiency
     * Large dataset handling
   - Animation Performance
     * Transition smoothness
     * Concurrent animation handling
     * Frame timing consistency
   - Visual Stability
     * Layout shift prevention
     * State change consistency
     * Visual update reliability

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Frame Rate Performance
   - Minimum 55fps during normal operation
   - Maximum 5 dropped frames allowed
   - Less than 3 jank instances
   - 60fps target maintenance

2. Visual Quality
   - Layout shift monitoring
   - Animation smoothness
   - State transition stability
   - Visual consistency

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added GPU profiling utilities
   - Implemented frame metrics tracking
   - Created visual stability monitoring
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added RenderMetrics interface
   - Fixed ExtendedParagraph compatibility
   - Added proper metrics initialization
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.gpu.test.tsx with comprehensive GPU tests
- Documented performance thresholds
- Added frame rate monitoring patterns
- Included visual stability guidelines

## Next Steps
1. Implement thread utilization tests:
   - Thread pool management
   - Thread lifecycle monitoring
   - Resource sharing patterns
   - Thread synchronization

2. Add resource contention tests:
   - CPU/GPU coordination
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Resource sharing efficiency
   - Bottleneck identification

3. Consider implementing:
   - WebGL performance tests
   - Canvas rendering tests
   - SVG performance tests
   - Animation optimization tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. GPU profiling infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Visual stability is monitored
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use requestAnimationFrame for frame timing
- Visual metrics are tracked per frame
- Performance thresholds are based on 60fps target
- Layout shifts are monitored with PerformanceObserver
- Added helper class for GPU profiling
- Frame metrics include duration and FPS
- Visual stability includes layout shift tracking
- Animation performance includes transition smoothness
- State changes are monitored for visual consistency
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
