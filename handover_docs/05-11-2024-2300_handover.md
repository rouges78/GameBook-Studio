## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on resource contention testing to ensure efficient memory usage and resource management.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented resource contention tests in StoryMap.resource.test.tsx:
   - Memory management tests
   - Resource allocation tests
   - Resource cleanup tests
   - Memory leak detection

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Memory Management
     * Memory usage stability
     * Memory pressure handling
     * GC activity monitoring
   - Resource Allocation
     * Allocation efficiency
     * Concurrent access
     * Resource contention
   - Resource Cleanup
     * Resource release
     * Memory recovery
     * Cleanup verification

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Memory Performance
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Limited large allocations
   - Reasonable GC activity
   - Stable memory usage

2. Resource Management
   - Allocation efficiency
   - Contention prevention
   - Resource cleanup
   - Memory recovery

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added ResourceMonitor utility
   - Implemented GC observation
   - Created memory tracking
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ResourceMetrics interface
   - Fixed Node type conversion
   - Added proper type guards
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.resource.test.tsx with comprehensive resource tests
- Documented memory monitoring patterns
- Added resource management guidelines
- Included cleanup strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement thread pool stress tests:
   - Maximum thread utilization
   - Recovery from exhaustion
   - Load balancing efficiency
   - Thread lifecycle management

2. Add resource pool tests:
   - Pool size optimization
   - Resource reuse patterns
   - Pool expansion/contraction
   - Resource invalidation

3. Consider implementing:
   - Memory fragmentation tests
   - Resource starvation tests
   - Deadlock prevention tests
   - Resource priority tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Resource monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Memory tracking is implemented
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use performance.memory API
- GC activity is monitored when available
- Resource metrics include memory and contention
- Memory pressure is simulated
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Resource cleanup is verified
- Memory leaks are tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust memory thresholds based on environment
