## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on thread pool stress testing to ensure efficient task management and resource utilization.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented thread pool stress tests in StoryMap.pool.test.tsx:
   - Pool utilization tests
   - Task management tests
   - Pool lifecycle tests
   - Load balancing verification

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Pool Utilization
     * Maximum thread usage
     * Pool exhaustion recovery
     * Task distribution
   - Task Management
     * Task prioritization
     * Task cancellation
     * Queue management
   - Pool Lifecycle
     * Pool expansion/contraction
     * Load adaptation
     * Resource optimization

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Thread Pool Performance
   - Maximum 4 active threads
   - Zero task failures
   - Sub-100ms processing time
   - Efficient queue management

2. Resource Management
   - Pool size optimization
   - Task prioritization
   - Cancellation handling
   - Load balancing

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added ThreadPoolMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created task simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added PoolMetrics interface
   - Fixed Node type conversion
   - Added proper type guards
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.pool.test.tsx with comprehensive pool tests
- Documented thread pool monitoring patterns
- Added task management guidelines
- Included load balancing strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement resource pool tests:
   - Pool size optimization
   - Resource reuse patterns
   - Pool expansion/contraction
   - Resource invalidation

2. Add thread scheduling tests:
   - Priority scheduling
   - Task preemption
   - Fairness verification
   - Starvation prevention

3. Consider implementing:
   - Pool configuration tests
   - Resource allocation tests
   - Load distribution tests
   - Recovery strategy tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Thread pool monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Task management is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom ThreadPoolMonitor
- Task metrics include processing time and status
- Pool lifecycle is monitored
- Load balancing is verified
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Task prioritization is tested
- Resource cleanup is confirmed
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust pool size based on environment
- Task cancellation is properly handled
- Pool expansion/contraction is monitored
- Load adaptation is verified
- Resource optimization is tested
