## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on resource pool testing to ensure efficient resource management and optimization.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented resource pool tests in StoryMap.resourcepool.test.tsx:
   - Pool size optimization tests
   - Resource reuse tests
   - Pool expansion/contraction tests
   - Resource invalidation tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Pool Size Optimization
     * Pool size maintenance
     * Resource reuse efficiency
     * Load adaptation
   - Pool Expansion/Contraction
     * Dynamic sizing
     * Load-based adaptation
     * Resource cleanup
   - Resource Invalidation
     * Cleanup verification
     * Resource lifecycle
     * Pool reset handling

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Resource Pool Performance
   - Limited pool growth
   - High resource reuse
   - Bounded pool sizes
   - Efficient adaptation

2. Resource Management
   - Pool size optimization
   - Resource reuse patterns
   - Invalidation handling
   - Cleanup verification

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added ResourcePoolMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created pool simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added PoolStats interface
   - Added ResourcePoolMetrics interface
   - Fixed Node type conversion
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.resourcepool.test.tsx with comprehensive pool tests
- Documented resource pool monitoring patterns
- Added pool management guidelines
- Included optimization strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement thread scheduling tests:
   - Priority scheduling
   - Task preemption
   - Fairness verification
   - Starvation prevention

2. Add resource starvation tests:
   - Resource contention
   - Deadlock prevention
   - Priority inversion
   - Resource hoarding

3. Consider implementing:
   - Pool configuration tests
   - Resource allocation tests
   - Load distribution tests
   - Recovery strategy tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Resource pool monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Pool management is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom ResourcePoolMonitor
- Pool metrics include size and usage statistics
- Resource reuse is tracked
- Pool adaptation is verified
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Pool optimization is tested
- Resource cleanup is confirmed
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust pool sizes based on environment
- Resource invalidation is properly handled
- Pool expansion/contraction is monitored
- Load adaptation is verified
- Resource optimization is tested
