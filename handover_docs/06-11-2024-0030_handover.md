## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on thread scheduling testing to ensure efficient task management and fair resource allocation.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented thread scheduling tests in StoryMap.scheduling.test.tsx:
   - Priority scheduling tests
   - Task preemption tests
   - Fairness verification tests
   - Starvation prevention tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Priority Scheduling
     * Task priority handling
     * Preemptive scheduling
     * Priority inheritance
   - Fairness Verification
     * Priority inversion prevention
     * Starvation prevention
     * Resource allocation fairness
   - Task Preemption
     * Preemption overhead
     * Context switching
     * Task resumption

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Scheduling Performance
   - Wait time optimization
   - Turnaround time efficiency
   - Fairness index maintenance
   - Starvation prevention

2. Task Management
   - Priority handling
   - Preemption control
   - Resource allocation
   - Task lifecycle

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added SchedulingMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created task simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added TaskMetrics interface
   - Added SchedulingMetrics interface
   - Fixed Node type conversion
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.scheduling.test.tsx with comprehensive scheduling tests
- Documented thread scheduling patterns
- Added task management guidelines
- Included fairness strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement resource starvation tests:
   - Resource contention
   - Deadlock prevention
   - Priority inversion
   - Resource hoarding

2. Add scheduling policy tests:
   - Round-robin scheduling
   - Multilevel feedback queues
   - Real-time scheduling
   - Dynamic priority adjustment

3. Consider implementing:
   - Load balancing tests
   - Affinity scheduling tests
   - Gang scheduling tests
   - Work stealing tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Thread scheduling infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Task management is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom SchedulingMonitor
- Task metrics include timing and priority
- Fairness is measured using Jain's index
- Preemption is tracked
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Priority inheritance is tested
- Resource cleanup is confirmed
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust scheduling parameters based on environment
- Task preemption is properly handled
- Priority inversion is prevented
- Starvation is monitored
- Resource fairness is verified
