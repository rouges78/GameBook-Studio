## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on resource starvation testing to ensure fair resource allocation and prevent deadlocks.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented resource starvation tests in StoryMap.starvation.test.tsx:
   - Resource contention tests
   - Deadlock prevention tests
   - Resource fairness tests
   - Priority inversion tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Resource Contention
     * Starvation prevention
     * Deadlock handling
     * Resource utilization
   - Resource Fairness
     * Fair allocation
     * Priority inheritance
     * Resource distribution
   - Resource Monitoring
     * Usage tracking
     * Contention detection
     * Resource metrics

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Resource Management
   - Starvation prevention
   - Deadlock avoidance
   - Priority inversion
   - Resource utilization

2. Resource Metrics
   - Acquisition tracking
   - Contention monitoring
   - Wait time analysis
   - Hold time tracking

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added StarvationMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created resource simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ResourceStats interface
   - Added StarvationMetrics interface
   - Fixed Map.get() null checks
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.starvation.test.tsx with comprehensive starvation tests
- Documented resource monitoring patterns
- Added fairness verification guidelines
- Included deadlock prevention strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement scheduling policy tests:
   - Round-robin scheduling
   - Multilevel feedback queues
   - Real-time scheduling
   - Dynamic priority adjustment

2. Add load balancing tests:
   - Resource distribution
   - Load measurement
   - Balancing strategies
   - Migration policies

3. Consider implementing:
   - Resource quota tests
   - Admission control tests
   - Resource reservation tests
   - Quality of service tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Resource monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Fairness metrics are implemented
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom StarvationMonitor
- Resource metrics include acquisition and release stats
- Deadlock detection is implemented
- Livelock detection is added
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Priority inheritance is tested
- Resource cleanup is confirmed
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Resource contention is properly handled
- Priority inversion is prevented
- Starvation is monitored
- Resource fairness is verified
