## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on scheduling policy testing to ensure efficient task scheduling and fair resource allocation.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented scheduling policy tests in StoryMap.policy.test.tsx:
   - Round-robin scheduling tests
   - Multilevel feedback queue tests
   - Real-time scheduling tests
   - Dynamic priority adjustment tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Round-Robin Scheduling
     * Time slice allocation
     * Fair execution
     * Context switching
   - Multilevel Feedback Queue
     * Queue level management
     * Quantum adjustment
     * Priority adaptation
   - Real-time Scheduling
     * Deadline management
     * Priority handling
     * Timing constraints

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Scheduling Performance
   - Response time
   - Turnaround time
   - Waiting time
   - CPU utilization

2. Task Management
   - Priority handling
   - Quantum allocation
   - Context switching
   - Task lifecycle

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added SchedulingPolicyMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created task simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added TaskInfo interface
   - Added PolicyMetrics interface
   - Fixed task tracking
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.policy.test.tsx with comprehensive policy tests
- Documented scheduling patterns
- Added task management guidelines
- Included policy optimization strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement load balancing tests:
   - Resource distribution
   - Load measurement
   - Balancing strategies
   - Migration policies

2. Add scheduling optimization tests:
   - Cache awareness
   - NUMA awareness
   - Power efficiency
   - Thermal management

3. Consider implementing:
   - Affinity scheduling tests
   - Gang scheduling tests
   - Work stealing tests
   - Load prediction tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Scheduling policy infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Task management is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom SchedulingPolicyMonitor
- Task metrics include timing and priority
- Multiple scheduling policies are tested
- Context switching is tracked
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Round-robin fairness is tested
- Multilevel feedback is verified
- Real-time constraints are checked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust scheduling parameters based on environment
- Priority adjustment is properly handled
- Task quantum is managed
- CPU utilization is monitored
- Response time is verified
