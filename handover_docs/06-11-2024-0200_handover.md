## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on load balancing testing to ensure efficient resource distribution and optimal performance.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented load balancing tests in StoryMap.balance.test.tsx:
   - Load distribution tests
   - Resource utilization tests
   - Dynamic load handling tests
   - Resource constraint tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Load Distribution
     * Worker load balancing
     * Task migration
     * Load imbalance monitoring
   - Resource Utilization
     * Resource optimization
     * Constraint handling
     * Usage monitoring
   - Load Metrics
     * Load variance
     * Hotspot detection
     * Migration tracking

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Load Management
   - Load imbalance
   - Load variance
   - Hotspot detection
   - Migration efficiency

2. Resource Metrics
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Response time
   - Throughput

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added LoadBalanceMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created worker simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added WorkerLoad interface
   - Added LoadMetrics interface
   - Fixed worker tracking
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.balance.test.tsx with comprehensive balancing tests
- Documented load monitoring patterns
- Added resource management guidelines
- Included optimization strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement scheduling optimization tests:
   - Cache awareness
   - NUMA awareness
   - Power efficiency
   - Thermal management

2. Add affinity scheduling tests:
   - Thread affinity
   - Core binding
   - Cache affinity
   - Memory locality

3. Consider implementing:
   - Gang scheduling tests
   - Work stealing tests
   - Load prediction tests
   - Resource reservation tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Load balancing infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Resource monitoring is implemented
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom LoadBalanceMonitor
- Worker metrics include load and resource usage
- Load distribution is tracked
- Task migration is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Load imbalance is measured
- Resource utilization is verified
- Response time is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Load migration is properly handled
- Resource constraints are tested
- Hotspots are monitored
- Throughput is verified
