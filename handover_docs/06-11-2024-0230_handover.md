## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on scheduling optimization testing to ensure efficient resource usage and optimal performance.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented scheduling optimization tests in StoryMap.optimization.test.tsx:
   - Cache optimization tests
   - NUMA optimization tests
   - Power optimization tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Cache Optimization
     * Hit rate monitoring
     * Miss latency tracking
     * Data locality analysis
   - NUMA Optimization
     * Memory locality
     * Node balancing
     * Migration tracking
   - Power Optimization
     * Energy efficiency
     * Thermal management
     * Frequency scaling

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Cache Performance
   - Cache hit rate
   - Miss latency
   - Data locality
   - Eviction patterns

2. Memory Access
   - NUMA locality
   - Memory affinity
   - Cross-node latency
   - Migration efficiency

3. Power Management
   - Energy efficiency
   - Thermal behavior
   - CPU frequency
   - Power consumption

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added OptimizationMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created simulation tools
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added CacheMetrics interface
   - Added NumaMetrics interface
   - Added PowerMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.optimization.test.tsx with comprehensive optimization tests
- Documented performance monitoring patterns
- Added resource optimization guidelines
- Included efficiency strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement affinity scheduling tests:
   - Thread affinity
   - Core binding
   - Cache affinity
   - Memory locality

2. Add gang scheduling tests:
   - Task grouping
   - Synchronization
   - Resource allocation
   - Group migration

3. Consider implementing:
   - Work stealing tests
   - Load prediction tests
   - Resource reservation tests
   - QoS management tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Optimization monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Resource efficiency is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom OptimizationMonitor
- Cache metrics include hits and misses
- NUMA metrics track locality
- Power metrics monitor efficiency
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Cache optimization is verified
- Memory locality is tested
- Power efficiency is monitored
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Cache behavior is properly tracked
- NUMA access is monitored
- Power states are verified
- Overall efficiency is measured
