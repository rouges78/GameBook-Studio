## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on affinity scheduling testing to ensure optimal thread and memory locality.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented affinity scheduling tests in StoryMap.affinity.test.tsx:
   - Thread affinity tests
   - Memory locality tests
   - Load balancing tests
   - Cache optimization tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Thread Affinity
     * Cache affinity
     * Core binding
     * Migration tracking
   - Memory Locality
     * Access patterns
     * TLB performance
     * Page fault handling
   - Load Balancing
     * Core utilization
     * Task distribution
     * Migration efficiency

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Cache Performance
   - Hit rates
   - Miss latency
   - Eviction patterns
   - Data locality

2. Memory Access
   - Local vs remote
   - TLB efficiency
   - Page faults
   - Bandwidth usage

3. Core Utilization
   - Load balance
   - Task distribution
   - Migration costs
   - Performance index

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added AffinityMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created core simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added CoreMetrics interface
   - Added MemoryMetrics interface
   - Added AffinityMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.affinity.test.tsx with comprehensive affinity tests
- Documented thread monitoring patterns
- Added memory optimization guidelines
- Included load balancing strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement gang scheduling tests:
   - Task grouping
   - Synchronization
   - Resource allocation
   - Group migration

2. Add work stealing tests:
   - Queue management
   - Task stealing
   - Load redistribution
   - Fairness control

3. Consider implementing:
   - Load prediction tests
   - Resource reservation tests
   - QoS management tests
   - Power management tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Affinity monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Core utilization is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom AffinityMonitor
- Core metrics include utilization and tasks
- Memory metrics track access patterns
- Load balance is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Thread affinity is verified
- Memory locality is tested
- Load distribution is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Cache behavior is properly tracked
- TLB performance is monitored
- Page faults are verified
- Overall efficiency is measured
