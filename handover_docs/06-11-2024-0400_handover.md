## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on work stealing testing to ensure efficient load balancing and task distribution.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented work stealing tests in StoryMap.stealing.test.tsx:
   - Task stealing tests
   - Queue management tests
   - Fairness control tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Task Stealing
     * Load balancing
     * Steal success rate
     * Victim selection
   - Queue Management
     * Queue operations
     * Task distribution
     * Latency tracking
   - Fairness Control
     * Resource distribution
     * Victim protection
     * Balance maintenance

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Load Distribution
   - Task stealing
   - Queue balance
   - Fairness metrics
   - Success rates

2. Performance Metrics
   - Throughput
   - Latency
   - Load imbalance
   - Fairness index

3. Queue Operations
   - Task addition
   - Task completion
   - Steal attempts
   - Queue monitoring

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added WorkStealingMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created queue simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added WorkerQueue interface
   - Added StealingMetrics interface
   - Fixed queue tracking
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.stealing.test.tsx with comprehensive stealing tests
- Documented queue monitoring patterns
- Added fairness guidelines
- Included balancing strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement load prediction tests:
   - Workload analysis
   - Resource forecasting
   - Adaptive scheduling
   - Performance modeling

2. Add resource reservation tests:
   - Quota management
   - Reservation tracking
   - Admission control
   - QoS enforcement

3. Consider implementing:
   - Power management tests
   - Thermal optimization tests
   - Energy efficiency tests
   - Cost modeling tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Work stealing infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Queue management is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom WorkStealingMonitor
- Queue metrics include tasks and steals
- Fairness is tracked
- Latency is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Task stealing is verified
- Queue balance is tested
- Fairness control is monitored
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Queue operations are properly handled
- Steal attempts are tracked
- Victim selection is monitored
- Overall efficiency is verified
