## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on power management testing to ensure energy efficiency and thermal control.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented power management tests in StoryMap.power.test.tsx:
   - Energy efficiency tests
   - Thermal management tests
   - Dynamic frequency scaling tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Energy Efficiency
     * Power consumption
     * Energy efficiency
     * Power saving time
   - Thermal Management
     * Temperature control
     * Thermal throttling
     * Heat dissipation
   - Frequency Scaling
     * Dynamic adjustment
     * Workload adaptation
     * Performance levels

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Power Management
   - Core states
   - Voltage scaling
   - Frequency control
   - Power consumption

2. Thermal Control
   - Temperature monitoring
   - Throttling events
   - Thermal headroom
   - Heat management

3. Performance Metrics
   - Energy efficiency
   - Performance index
   - Resource utilization
   - Core utilization

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added PowerMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created core simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added CoreState interface
   - Added PowerState interface
   - Added PowerMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.power.test.tsx with comprehensive power tests
- Documented power monitoring patterns
- Added thermal management guidelines
- Included efficiency strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement cost modeling tests:
   - Resource pricing
   - Usage tracking
   - Cost optimization
   - Budget control

2. Add SLA compliance tests:
   - Service levels
   - Performance targets
   - Availability metrics
   - Response times

3. Consider implementing:
   - Reliability tests
   - Scalability tests
   - Elasticity tests
   - Recovery tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Power management infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Thermal control is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
