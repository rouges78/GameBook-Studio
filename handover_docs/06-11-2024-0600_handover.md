## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on cost modeling testing to ensure efficient resource pricing and budget control.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented cost modeling tests in StoryMap.cost.test.tsx:
   - Resource pricing tests
   - Budget control tests
   - Cost optimization tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Resource Pricing
     * Cost calculation
     * Resource tracking
     * Usage monitoring
   - Budget Control
     * Limit enforcement
     * Alert management
     * Usage tracking
   - Cost Optimization
     * Resource efficiency
     * Cost savings
     * Budget utilization

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Cost Management
   - Resource costs
   - Budget limits
   - Cost efficiency
   - Optimization score

2. Resource Tracking
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Storage usage
   - Network usage

3. Budget Metrics
   - Utilization rate
   - Alert frequency
   - Savings rate
   - Efficiency score

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added CostMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created budget simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ResourceCost interface
   - Added BudgetLimits interface
   - Added CostMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.cost.test.tsx with comprehensive cost tests
- Documented cost monitoring patterns
- Added budget management guidelines
- Included optimization strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement SLA compliance tests:
   - Service levels
   - Performance targets
   - Availability metrics
   - Response times

2. Add reliability tests:
   - Fault tolerance
   - Error recovery
   - System stability
   - Data consistency

3. Consider implementing:
   - Scalability tests
   - Elasticity tests
   - Recovery tests
   - Resilience tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Cost monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Budget control is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom CostMonitor
- Resource costs include all components
- Budget limits are tracked
- Cost efficiency is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Resource pricing is verified
- Budget control is tested
- Cost optimization is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Cost calculation is properly handled
- Budget alerts are monitored
- Resource usage is verified
- Overall efficiency is measured
