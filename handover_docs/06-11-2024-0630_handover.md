## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on SLA compliance testing to ensure service level agreements are met.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented SLA compliance tests in StoryMap.sla.test.tsx:
   - Performance target tests
   - Availability requirement tests
   - Error rate compliance tests
   - Service level monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Performance Targets
     * Response time
     * Throughput
     * Service levels
   - Availability Requirements
     * Uptime tracking
     * MTTR measurement
     * MTBF calculation
   - Error Rate Compliance
     * Error tracking
     * Rate monitoring
     * Violation detection

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Service Levels
   - Response time
   - Availability
   - Throughput
   - Error rates

2. Compliance Metrics
   - SLA violations
   - Compliance rate
   - Recovery time
   - Uptime

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Service metrics
   - Failure tracking
   - Recovery tracking
   - Overall performance

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added SlaMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created service simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ServiceLevel interface
   - Added SlaTarget interface
   - Added SlaMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.sla.test.tsx with comprehensive SLA tests
- Documented service monitoring patterns
- Added compliance guidelines
- Included performance strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement reliability tests:
   - Fault tolerance
   - Error recovery
   - System stability
   - Data consistency

2. Add scalability tests:
   - Load handling
   - Resource scaling
   - Performance limits
   - Growth capacity

3. Consider implementing:
   - Recovery tests
   - Resilience tests
   - Durability tests
   - Stability tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. SLA monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Service levels are verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom SlaMonitor
- Service metrics include all SLA components
- Performance targets are tracked
- Availability is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Response time is verified
- Error rates are tested
- Recovery time is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Service levels are properly handled
- Compliance is monitored
- Recovery is verified
- Overall performance is measured
