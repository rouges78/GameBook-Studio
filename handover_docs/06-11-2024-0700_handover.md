## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on reliability testing to ensure fault tolerance and error recovery.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented reliability tests in StoryMap.reliability.test.tsx:
   - Fault tolerance tests
   - Error recovery tests
   - System stability tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Fault Tolerance
     * Error handling
     * System resilience
     * Recovery mechanisms
   - Error Recovery
     * Recovery time
     * Data consistency
     * Service restoration
   - System Stability
     * Long-term operation
     * Resource health
     * Operational status

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Error Management
   - Error detection
   - Error handling
   - Recovery tracking
   - System state

2. Reliability Metrics
   - MTTF (Mean Time To Failure)
   - MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
   - Availability
   - Reliability

3. System Health
   - Data consistency
   - Resource health
   - Operational status
   - Recovery progress

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added ReliabilityMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created error simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ErrorEvent interface
   - Added SystemState interface
   - Added ReliabilityMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.reliability.test.tsx with comprehensive reliability tests
- Documented error monitoring patterns
- Added recovery guidelines
- Included stability strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement scalability tests:
   - Load handling
   - Resource scaling
   - Performance limits
   - Growth capacity

2. Add elasticity tests:
   - Dynamic scaling
   - Resource adaptation
   - Load balancing
   - Performance optimization

3. Consider implementing:
   - Recovery tests
   - Resilience tests
   - Durability tests
   - Stability tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Reliability monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Error handling is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom ReliabilityMonitor
- Error metrics include all failure types
- Recovery times are tracked
- System health is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Error handling is verified
- Recovery is tested
- Stability is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Error recovery is properly handled
- System health is monitored
- Stability is verified
- Overall reliability is measured
