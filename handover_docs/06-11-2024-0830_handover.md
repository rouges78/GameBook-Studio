## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on recovery testing to ensure failure recovery and state restoration.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented recovery tests in StoryMap.recovery.test.tsx:
   - Failure recovery tests
   - State restoration tests
   - Service continuity tests
   - Recovery monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Failure Recovery
     * Error handling
     * Recovery process
     * Success rates
     * Recovery time
   - State Restoration
     * State consistency
     * Data integrity
     * Snapshot management
     * Recovery points
   - Service Continuity
     * Availability
     * Uptime tracking
     * Failure handling
     * Service stability

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Recovery Management
   - Failure events
   - Recovery time
   - Success rates
   - Data loss

2. State Management
   - State snapshots
   - Data consistency
   - State validity
   - Recovery points

3. Service Metrics
   - Availability
   - Recovery efficiency
   - MTTR
   - State consistency

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added RecoveryMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created failure simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added FailureEvent interface
   - Added StateSnapshot interface
   - Added RecoveryMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.recovery.test.tsx with comprehensive recovery tests
- Documented failure monitoring patterns
- Added recovery guidelines
- Included continuity strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement resilience tests:
   - System stability
   - Error handling
   - Recovery patterns
   - Fault tolerance

2. Add durability tests:
   - Data persistence
   - State durability
   - Recovery validation
   - Consistency checks

3. Consider implementing:
   - Stability tests
   - Longevity tests
   - Endurance tests
   - Stress recovery tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Recovery monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Failure handling is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom RecoveryMonitor
- Failure metrics include all error types
- Recovery times are tracked
- State consistency is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Failure handling is verified
- Recovery process is tested
- Service continuity is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Recovery process is properly handled
- State restoration is monitored
- Service stability is verified
- Overall reliability is measured
