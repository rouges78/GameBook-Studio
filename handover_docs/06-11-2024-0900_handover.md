## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on resilience testing to ensure system stability and error handling.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented resilience tests in StoryMap.resilience.test.tsx:
   - System stability tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Recovery pattern tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - System Stability
     * Stress handling
     * Degradation control
     * Stability metrics
     * Recovery rates
   - Error Handling
     * Error detection
     * Error recovery
     * Handling rates
     * Recovery success
   - Recovery Patterns
     * Pattern recognition
     * Recovery steps
     * Success rates
     * Time metrics

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Stability Management
   - System state
   - Degradation levels
   - Error rates
   - Recovery rates

2. Error Metrics
   - Error conditions
   - Handling rates
   - Recovery capability
   - MTTF/MTTR

3. Recovery Metrics
   - Recovery patterns
   - Success rates
   - Time to recovery
   - Pattern efficiency

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added ResilienceMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created stability simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ErrorCondition interface
   - Added SystemState interface
   - Added ResilienceMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.resilience.test.tsx with comprehensive resilience tests
- Documented stability monitoring patterns
- Added error handling guidelines
- Included recovery strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement durability tests:
   - Data persistence
   - State durability
   - Recovery validation
   - Consistency checks

2. Add stability tests:
   - Long-term operation
   - System endurance
   - Resource stability
   - Performance consistency

3. Consider implementing:
   - Longevity tests
   - Endurance tests
   - Stress recovery tests
   - Stability validation tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Resilience monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Error handling is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom ResilienceMonitor
- Error metrics include all failure types
- Recovery patterns are tracked
- System stability is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Error handling is verified
- Recovery patterns are tested
- Stability is tracked
- Error handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Error handling is properly managed
- Recovery patterns are monitored
- System stability is verified
- Overall resilience is measured
