## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on stability testing to ensure long-term operation and system endurance.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented stability tests in StoryMap.stability.test.tsx:
   - Long-term operation tests
   - System endurance tests
   - Resource stability tests
   - Performance monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Long-term Operation
     * Extended runtime
     * System stability
     * Performance metrics
     * Health monitoring
   - System Endurance
     * Continuous load
     * Resource usage
     * System wear
     * Performance degradation
   - Resource Stability
     * Resource efficiency
     * Usage patterns
     * System events
     * Health metrics

### Test Coverage Areas
1. System Health
   - Stability metrics
   - Performance tracking
   - Reliability measures
   - Health scores

2. Resource Management
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Render times
   - Response times

3. System Events
   - Event tracking
   - Impact analysis
   - Duration monitoring
   - Recovery patterns

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added StabilityMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created stability simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added SystemEvent interface
   - Added ResourceMetrics interface
   - Added StabilityMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.stability.test.tsx with comprehensive stability tests
- Documented system monitoring patterns
- Added endurance guidelines
- Included stability strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement longevity tests:
   - Extended operation
   - Resource management
   - Performance stability
   - System health

2. Add endurance tests:
   - System durability
   - Resource endurance
   - Performance longevity
   - Health tracking

3. Consider implementing:
   - Stress recovery tests
   - Stability validation tests
   - Performance verification tests
   - Health monitoring tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Stability monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. System endurance is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom StabilityMonitor
- System metrics include all resource types
- Events are tracked
- Performance is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- System stability is verified
- Resource usage is tested
- Endurance is tracked
- Event handling patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- System events are properly handled
- Resource usage is monitored
- Performance stability is verified
- Overall health is measured
