## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on endurance testing to ensure system durability and resource efficiency.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented endurance tests in StoryMap.endurance.test.tsx:
   - System durability tests
   - Resource endurance tests
   - Performance longevity tests
   - Resource monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - System Durability
     * Continuous load
     * System health
     * Warning detection
     * Performance tracking
   - Resource Endurance
     * Memory usage
     * CPU utilization
     * IO operations
     * Resource efficiency
   - Performance Longevity
     * FPS stability
     * Frame timing
     * Render efficiency
     * Update cycles

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Resource Monitoring
   - Memory metrics
   - CPU metrics
   - IO metrics
   - Performance data

2. System Health
   - Stability tracking
   - Efficiency metrics
   - Endurance scores
   - Warning systems

3. Performance Metrics
   - FPS monitoring
   - Frame timing
   - Render times
   - Update cycles

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added EnduranceMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created resource simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ResourceUsage interface
   - Added PerformanceMetrics interface
   - Added EnduranceMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.endurance.test.tsx with comprehensive endurance tests
- Documented resource monitoring patterns
- Added performance guidelines
- Included durability strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement stress recovery tests:
   - System resilience
   - Resource recovery
   - Performance restoration
   - Health maintenance

2. Add stability validation tests:
   - System verification
   - Resource validation
   - Performance checks
   - Health assessment

3. Consider implementing:
   - Performance verification tests
   - Health monitoring tests
   - Resource tracking tests
   - Stability checks

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Endurance monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Resource usage is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom EnduranceMonitor
- Resource metrics include all usage types
- Performance is tracked
- Health is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Resource usage is verified
- Performance metrics are tested
- Health scores are tracked
- Warning patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Resource usage is properly handled
- Performance metrics are monitored
- System health is verified
- Overall endurance is measured
