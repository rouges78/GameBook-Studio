## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on stress recovery testing to ensure system resilience and performance restoration.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented stress recovery tests in StoryMap.stressrecovery.test.tsx:
   - System resilience tests
   - Resource recovery tests
   - Performance restoration tests
   - Recovery monitoring tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - System Resilience
     * Stress handling
     * Recovery cycles
     * System stability
     * Health monitoring
   - Resource Recovery
     * Resource availability
     * Usage patterns
     * Recovery efficiency
     * Capacity management
   - Performance Restoration
     * Performance levels
     * Degradation patterns
     * Recovery speed
     * Stability metrics

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Stress Management
   - Stress events
   - Recovery attempts
   - Success rates
   - Recovery times

2. System Health
   - Load levels
   - Stability metrics
   - Responsiveness
   - Recovery capacity

3. Recovery Metrics
   - Recovery rate
   - Recovery time
   - Resilience
   - Stress resistance

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added StressRecoveryMonitor utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created stress simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added StressEvent interface
   - Added SystemState interface
   - Added StressRecoveryMetrics interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.stressrecovery.test.tsx with comprehensive stress recovery tests
- Documented stress monitoring patterns
- Added recovery guidelines
- Included resilience strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement stability validation tests:
   - System verification
   - Resource validation
   - Performance checks
   - Health assessment

2. Add performance verification tests:
   - Performance validation
   - Resource verification
   - System checks
   - Health monitoring

3. Consider implementing:
   - Health monitoring tests
   - Resource tracking tests
   - Stability checks
   - Verification tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Stress recovery monitoring infrastructure is in place
2. Performance thresholds are established
3. Recovery patterns are verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom StressRecoveryMonitor
- Stress metrics include all event types
- Recovery patterns are tracked
- Health is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Stress handling is verified
- Recovery patterns are tested
- Health metrics are tracked
- Recovery patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Stress handling is properly managed
- Recovery metrics are monitored
- System health is verified
- Overall resilience is measured
