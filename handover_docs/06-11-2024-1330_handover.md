## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We're implementing comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, with a current focus on resource tracking testing to ensure resource validation and usage monitoring.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Implemented resource tracking tests in StoryMap.resourcetracking.test.tsx:
   - Resource validation tests
   - Usage monitoring tests
   - Efficiency monitoring tests
   - Resource tracking tests

2. Test Categories Added:
   - Resource Validation
     * Resource usage
     * Resource allocation
     * Resource efficiency
     * Alert monitoring
   - Usage Monitoring
     * CPU metrics
     * Memory metrics
     * IO metrics
     * Performance tracking
   - Efficiency Monitoring
     * Resource optimization
     * Usage patterns
     * System efficiency
     * Health metrics

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Resource Metrics
   - Resource usage
   - Resource allocation
   - Resource efficiency
   - Alert systems

2. System Metrics
   - CPU monitoring
   - Memory tracking
   - IO operations
   - Performance data

3. Efficiency Metrics
   - Utilization scores
   - Efficiency scores
   - Optimization scores
   - Health scores

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Added ResourceTracker utility
   - Implemented metrics tracking
   - Created tracking simulation
   - Enhanced type safety

2. Type System Improvements:
   - Added ResourceUsage interface
   - Added ResourceMetrics interface
   - Added ResourceStats interface
   - Enhanced error handling

## Documentation Updates
- Added tests/StoryMap.resourcetracking.test.tsx with comprehensive tracking tests
- Documented resource monitoring patterns
- Added usage guidelines
- Included efficiency strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement stability checks:
   - System validation
   - Resource verification
   - Performance checks
   - Health monitoring

2. Add verification tests:
   - System verification
   - Resource validation
   - Performance checks
   - Health assessment

3. Consider implementing:
   - Monitoring tests
   - Tracking tests
   - Assessment tests
   - Validation tests

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
1. Resource tracking infrastructure is in place
2. Resource thresholds are established
3. System monitoring is verified
4. Type safety is improved
5. Consider adding more edge cases

## Additional Context
- Tests use custom ResourceTracker
- Resource metrics include all usage types
- System metrics are tracked
- Health is monitored
- Added helper functions for type conversion
- Resource tracking is verified
- Usage monitoring is tested
- Efficiency metrics are tracked
- Alert patterns are established
- Consider adding these tests to CI/CD pipeline with appropriate timeouts
- May need to adjust thresholds based on environment
- Resource tracking is properly handled
- Usage monitoring is tracked
- System efficiency is verified
- Overall tracking is measured
