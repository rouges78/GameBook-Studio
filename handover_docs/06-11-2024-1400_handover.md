## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We have completed the implementation of comprehensive testing for the StoryMap feature, covering all major aspects of system performance, stability, and reliability.

## Current Progress

### Completed Test Suites
1. Performance Tests (StoryMap.performance.test.tsx):
   - Performance metrics
   - System benchmarks
   - Load testing
   - Response times

2. Stress Tests (StoryMap.stress.test.tsx):
   - Load handling
   - System limits
   - Breaking points
   - Recovery patterns

3. Durability Tests (StoryMap.durability.test.tsx):
   - Data persistence
   - State consistency
   - Recovery validation
   - System resilience

4. Stability Tests (StoryMap.stability.test.tsx):
   - System stability
   - Error handling
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - Performance consistency

5. Longevity Tests (StoryMap.longevity.test.tsx):
   - Extended operation
   - Resource trends
   - System degradation
   - Health monitoring

6. Endurance Tests (StoryMap.endurance.test.tsx):
   - System durability
   - Resource endurance
   - Performance longevity
   - Health tracking

7. Validation Tests (StoryMap.validation.test.tsx):
