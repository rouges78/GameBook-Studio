## Project Overview
GameBook Studio is an interactive story creation tool. We have implemented comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization systems to meet production requirements:
- Memory usage < 80%
- CPU usage < 70%
- Response time < 100ms
- FPS > 55
- 99.9% uptime
- < 0.1% error rate

## Current Progress
