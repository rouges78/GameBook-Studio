## Project Overview
Fixed TypeScript configuration issues in GameBook Studio by reorganizing type definitions and improving module structure. The focus was on resolving import conflicts between ParagraphEditor and StoryMap components.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Created shared type definitions:
   - Added src/types/storymap.d.ts for common types
   - Moved shared interfaces (MapSettings, ExtendedParagraph, etc.) to central location

2. Updated component type imports:
   - Modified ParagraphEditor/types.ts to use shared types
   - Updated StoryMap/types.ts to re-export shared types
   - Removed duplicate type definitions

3. Fixed TypeScript configuration:
   - Corrected rootDir settings in tsconfig files
   - Separated frontend and Electron builds
   - Resolved module resolution conflicts

### Build Status
- Electron build: ✓ Successful
- Frontend build: ✓ Successful (with chunk size warnings)
- All TypeScript errors resolved

## Documentation Updates
- Created shared type definitions in src/types/storymap.d.ts
- Updated type imports in ParagraphEditor and StoryMap components
- Documented type sharing approach for future reference

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing code splitting to address chunk size warnings
2. Review other components for potential type sharing opportunities
3. Consider adding type documentation for shared interfaces

## Notes for Next Session
- The chunk size warning in the build output can be addressed if needed
- The type organization pattern used here can be applied to other shared types
- Consider documenting the type sharing approach in the project documentation

## Additional Context
The changes made have improved the project's type organization and resolved the build errors while maintaining type safety across components.
