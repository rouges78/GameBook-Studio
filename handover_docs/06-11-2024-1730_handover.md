## Project Overview
Refactored the ParagraphEditor component structure to improve organization and remove duplicate functionality. The focus was on consolidating action buttons and clarifying component responsibilities.

## Current Progress

### Completed Tasks
1. Removed duplicate action buttons:
   - Removed action buttons from ParagraphContent component
   - Consolidated all action buttons in EditorMain component
   - Updated component interfaces to reflect changes

2. Updated component interfaces:
   - Simplified ParagraphContent props
   - Ensured EditorMain maintains all action-related functionality
   - Updated ParagraphEditorControls to handle formatting and styling

3. Improved code organization:
   - Clarified component responsibilities
   - Removed redundant props
   - Maintained consistent styling across components

### Component Structure
- EditorMain: Main container, handles all actions (save, delete, export)
- ParagraphContent: Focuses on content editing and stats display
- ParagraphEditorControls: Handles formatting and styling options

## Documentation Updates
- Updated types in src/components/ParagraphEditor/types.ts
- Simplified component interfaces
- Maintained existing functionality while improving organization

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions
2. Add tooltips for formatting buttons
3. Consider implementing undo/redo functionality
4. Add tests for the refactored components

## Notes for Next Session
- The action buttons are now centralized in EditorMain
- ParagraphContent is now focused solely on content editing
- All formatting controls remain in ParagraphEditorControls
- The changes maintain existing functionality while improving code organization

## Additional Context
The refactoring improves maintainability by:
- Eliminating duplicate code
- Clarifying component responsibilities
- Making the codebase more maintainable
- Reducing potential for inconsistencies
