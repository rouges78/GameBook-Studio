2. Add keyboard shortcut help modal
3. Consider adding undo/redo functionality
4. Add tests for keyboard shortcuts

## Notes for Next Session
- All keyboard shortcuts are working
- Tooltips show available shortcuts
- Component organization is cleaner
- Type safety has been improved

## Additional Context
The changes improve user experience by adding keyboard shortcuts while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. The tooltips help users discover the available shortcuts.
