## Project Overview
GameBook-Studio is a text-based game creation tool. The current focus was on implementing undo/redo functionality in the ParagraphEditor component to improve the editing experience.

## Current Progress
### Completed Tasks:
1. Implemented undo/redo functionality:
   - Created new useHistory hook for managing content history
   - Added keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Shift+Z for redo)
   - Implemented visual UI controls for undo/redo actions
   - Added state tracking for undo/redo availability

2. Updated Components:
   - Modified ParagraphContent.tsx to integrate history functionality
   - Added visual indicators for undo/redo availability
   - Implemented keyboard event handlers

3. Added Translations:
   - Added new translation strings for undo/redo in both English and Italian
   - Added keyboard shortcut hints to translations

### Implementation Details:
- The useHistory hook maintains three states: past, present, and future
- Content changes are tracked and can be undone/redone
- Visual feedback shows when undo/redo actions are available
- Keyboard shortcuts are fully integrated with the editor

## Issues and Resolutions
No issues encountered during implementation.

## Documentation Updates
- Added new translations for undo/redo functionality
- Updated component structure with new useHistory hook

## Next Steps
1. Test the undo/redo functionality thoroughly with different content types
2. Consider adding a maximum history size to prevent memory issues
3. Add visual feedback when performing undo/redo actions
4. Consider implementing the keyboard shortcut help modal

## Notes for the Next Cline Session
- The undo/redo functionality is implemented as requested
- The implementation is ready for testing
- Consider adding automated tests for the history functionality
- The codebase remains in a stable state with the new features integrated
