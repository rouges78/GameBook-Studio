### Project Overview
This is a Gamebook Studio application built with React, TypeScript and Vite. It's a comprehensive tool for creating interactive gamebooks/choose-your-own-adventure stories with features like:

Interactive paragraph editor with rich text formatting
Visual story mapping and node connections
Multi-language support (English/Italian)
Dark/light theme
Image handling and editing
Export capabilities to multiple formats
Auto-saving and backup functionality
Project library management
The development server is already running, allowing real-time preview of changes. The project uses modern web technologies and follows a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns.

The core functionality revolves around creating and managing interactive narratives where each paragraph can connect to multiple others, creating branching storylines. The UI is polished and professional, with careful attention to user experience.

### Current Progress
- Updated the `update.md` file with the latest changes.
- Updated the version number in `README.md` to 0.1.2.
- Reviewed project structure and documentation.
- Analyzed the `StoryMapCanvas.tsx` component in the previous task.
- Noted the addition of background image functionality with adjustments for black and white, contrast, brightness, and transparency in the previous task.
- Observed improvements to zooming and panning in the Story Map in the previous task.
- Noted the addition of a context menu in the Story Map in the previous task.

### Issues and Resolutions
- The `read_file` tool failed to read `project-structure.txt`. Used `execute_command` with `type` to read the file.
- The `replace_in_file` tool failed to update the version in `README.md` due to a mismatch in the search block. Read the file again to get the exact content and then used `replace_in_file` with the correct search block.
- The `execute_command` tool failed to output the current date and time. Used `ask_followup_question` to get the current date and time from the user.

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `update.md` with the latest changes.
- Updated `README.md` with the correct version number.

### Next Steps
- Review the roadmap in `README.md` to ensure it aligns with the current development priorities.
- Continue development on the Story Map features.
- Address any pending issues.

### Notes for the Next Cline Session
- The development server is running.
- The project uses modern web technologies and follows a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns.
- The version number is now consistent across `package.json`, `update.md`, and `README.md`.
